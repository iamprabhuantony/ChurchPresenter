/**
 * A Bible item clicked in the schedule, while the Bible is still loading.
 *
 * This is the cold-start report: open the app, open a saved service, click its Bible item — the
 * output says Bible is live and shows nothing, and clicking the item again does nothing either.
 * Selecting any verse by hand first "initialises" it, after which the item works.
 *
 * Two separate faults produced that, and both are asserted here:
 *
 * - The reference was resolved against a Bible that was not loaded yet. `loadBibles` publishes a
 *   books-only module first and the full text second, so a lookup landing in that window finds no
 *   book (or a book whose chapters are empty) and quietly resolves to nothing.
 * - Clicking the same item twice changed nothing the effect was keyed on, so the second click could
 *   not recover from the first.
 *
 * **Why the shared `bibleTab` harness cannot cover this.** It builds the view model on
 * `Dispatchers.Unconfined`, which loads the Bible synchronously — before the tab is ever composed,
 * so the window this test is about does not exist there. The load is held shut here instead, with a
 * dispatcher that queues rather than runs, and opened once the tab is up and waiting.

    /**
     * A dispatcher that runs nothing until [release], then runs everything — including what arrives
     * after.
     *
     * Standing in for a slow disk: the view model's load is queued at construction and stays queued
     * while the tab composes and asks for its verse. Once released the gate stays open, because the
     * load can come back to it from another thread after [release] has returned: in a fresh JVM the
     * Bible's book names are read from compose resources for the first time, which suspends onto a
     * real IO thread. Work is still run one block at a time, by whichever thread finds it idle.
