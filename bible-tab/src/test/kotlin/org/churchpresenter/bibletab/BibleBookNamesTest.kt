/**
 * The table of Bible book names, checked as a table rather than as text.
 *
 * Sixty-six string resources are listed by hand in canonical order, and everything downstream
 * addresses a book by its position in that list — so a duplicated or missing entry does not fail,
 * it renames a book. `bible_book_40` appearing twice would leave one book showing another's name in
 * every one of the fifteen languages at once, and nothing about that is visible until someone opens
 * the Bible tab and reads it.
 *
 * Resolving a resource to its text normally goes through Compose's resource environment, which
 * needs a real display's DPI and throws `HeadlessException` in this suite — see
 * [ComposeResourceEnvironmentTestSupport]. The lookup tests below run under a fixed environment it
 * installs; everything else here needs only the table itself.
