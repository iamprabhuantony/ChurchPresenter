/**
 * The message that says a translation could not be read.
 *
 * A module that fails to load leaves an empty book list, which on its own is indistinguishable
 * from a Bible folder that was never set up — so the banner naming the file is the only thing
 * standing between the operator and a tab that is blank for no stated reason. These assert on the
 * file name and on the substring of the wording that carries the meaning.
 *
 * The failure driven here is a configured translation whose file is not on disk, because it needs
 * no byte-level fixture: the harness writes `test.spb` and the settings name a second module
 * beside it that was never written.
