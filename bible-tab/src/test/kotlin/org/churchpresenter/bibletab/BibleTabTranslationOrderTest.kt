/**
 * The multi-translation display-order panel — the dropdown behind the translation chip, which is the
 * only place the stacking order of three or more translations can be changed.
 *
 * The order is not cosmetic: the first translation is the *navigation* bible (the one whose book and
 * chapter list drives the tab) and the rest stack down the audience screen beneath it. Reordering
 * with the wrong index or a wrong offset silently repoints the whole tab at a different translation.
 *
 * Every row offers two ways to move: the up/down arrows, and dragging the row by its grip. Both end
 * at the same `moveBibleTranslation`, and both are covered here — the drag because it is the one an
 * operator reaches for, the arrows because they are the accessible route and because their disabled
 * state at the ends of the list is its own branch.
 *
 * The panel lives inside a `DropdownMenu`, so every test opens the chip first. Note that clicking a
 * row inside the menu does **not** close it, so an assertion after a click is still looking at the
 * open panel.
 *
 * See `BibleTabTestSupport.kt` for the harness.
