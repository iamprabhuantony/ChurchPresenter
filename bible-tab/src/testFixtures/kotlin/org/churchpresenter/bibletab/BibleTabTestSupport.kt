/**
 * Harness and fixtures shared by the `BibleTab` test classes.
 *
 * **Why this tab is testable at all.** `BibleTab` needs a real [BibleViewModel], which loads its
 * modules off disk. Its scope and its file reads used to be hardcoded to `Dispatchers.Main` and
 * `Dispatchers.IO`, so a test could only poll a wall clock for the load — the same shape that made
 * the Songs tests flaky under contention (issue #56). Both are now injectable, exactly as on
 * `SongsViewModel`, so passing immediate dispatchers loads the Bible *synchronously* and the tab
 * becomes ordinary Compose: build the model, compose the tab, assert on what is on screen.
 *
 * Nothing is stubbed. The `.spb` module is written with the real [SpbFixture] and read back through
 * the real load path, so a fixture cannot drift from the format the app actually parses. `BibleTab`
 * needs no host window and no `BibleOutput` — those parameters are optional and the tab renders
 * its browse/search UI without them. STT is optional too, but passing a connected [STTManager] is
 * what draws the auto-follow panel (see the `stt` parameter), and a connected manager needs no socket
 * since [STTManager.applyConnected] is the same transition its own socket callback runs.
 */

 * Genesis, Psalms and John, with verse text distinct enough that a search can only match one.
 *
 * Deliberately not [SpbFixture.sampleContent]: the browse columns are asserted against, so the
 * shape here is chosen to be unambiguous — Genesis 1 has three verses and Genesis 2 has one, no two
 * verses share wording, and every book has a verse in its first chapter so that selecting a book
 * always lands on something. The chapter counts are the real ones for Psalms 23 and John 3, because
 * those are the references the smart search is exercised with.
