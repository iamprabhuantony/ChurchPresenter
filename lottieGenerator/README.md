# ChurchPresenter LottieGen

A standalone Compose Desktop application for generating animated lower-third overlays as Lottie JSON files.

Built with Kotlin Multiplatform + Compose Desktop. Can run standalone or embedded inside [ChurchPresenter](https://github.com/ChurchPresenter/ChurchPresenter).

## Features

- **12 animation styles** — Bar, Boxed, Circular, Banner, Gradient Bar, Line Split, Random Fade, Diagonal, Diagonal Wipe, Double Line, News Ticker, News Badge
- **Live preview** — Real-time Lottie animation preview with play/pause and seek
- **Full customization** — Text, fonts (18 families, including Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari, Thai, Lao and Tamil), colors, shape, logo, timing, position, canvas size
- **Text shaping** — scripts whose letters join or change shape (Tamil, Devanagari, Arabic, Thai…) are drawn as whole lines so they read correctly; the setting (Auto / Whole lines / Letter by letter) is saved in the file
- **Preset system** — Save and load animation presets
- **Color theme library** — 8 built-in themes + save custom themes (shared with ChurchPresenter)
- **Logo support** — Import and embed logos from file system
- **Cross-platform** — Windows (MSI), macOS (DMG), Linux (DEB)

## Running Standalone

```shell
./gradlew run
```

## Animation Style Editor (developer tool)

A developer-only "video editor for animation styles": author a new style as a declarative
spec document (elements, slots, keyframe tracks) with instant live preview, a scrubbable
timeline, and a 12-cell test matrix (3 alignments × logo × background) — no per-iteration
rebuild. Finished specs ship compiled into releases like every other style.

- Standalone: `./gradlew run --args="--editor"`
- Inside ChurchPresenter: **Developer → Animation Style Editor…** (dev builds or
  `CHURCHPRESENTER_FORCE_DEV_WINDOW=true` only)
- Authoring/registration workflow: see **Path B** in [ADDING_ANIMATIONS.md](ADDING_ANIMATIONS.md)

## Building Installers

```shell
# Windows
./gradlew packageMsi

# macOS
./gradlew packageDmg

# Linux
./gradlew packageDeb
```

Requires JDK 21.

## Integration with ChurchPresenter

This project is a Gradle module of the ChurchPresenter build (`:lottieGenerator`). The app takes it as `implementation(projects.lottieGenerator)` and launches it as a separate Compose window from the Lower Third settings.

When running inside ChurchPresenter:
- Canvas size defaults to the presenter display resolution
- Files save directly to the configured lower third folder
- The file list refreshes automatically after saving
