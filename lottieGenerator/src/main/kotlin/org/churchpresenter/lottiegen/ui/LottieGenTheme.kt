/**
 * The tool's theme for the standalone window.
 *
 * The Material layer — colour scheme, typography, shapes, semantic colours — is
 * [ChurchPresenterTheme]'s, the same one every ChurchPresenter screen uses. This module used to
 * build its own: a `ColorScheme` derived from [LottieGenPalette] and a full `Typography` that
 * restated Material's defaults. Both were duplicates, and the colour one meant the tool's dialogs
 * and dropdown menus drifted from the app's whenever a theme changed on one side only.
 *
 * What stays the tool's own is the hand-drawn panel chrome: [LottieGenPalette] and the [Tokens]
 * that read it. Those are 51 roles — canvas checkerboard, transport track, live dot, badge and
 * logo chips — that Material has no equivalent for, so they are not duplication.
 *
 * [dark] picks the palette and the theme mode together; standalone stays dark, which is what the
 * generator has always looked like. Embedded in a host app it is [ProvideLottieGenPalette] that
 * runs instead — the host owns the MaterialTheme there and only the palette has to be supplied.

/**
 * Puts [palette] — and the scrollbar styling that goes with it — in scope for the panel chrome,
 * leaving the ambient MaterialTheme alone.
 *
 * This is the embedded path: ChurchPresenter has already applied its own theme around the
 * generator, so replacing it would be wrong, but the hand-drawn chrome still has to be told which
 * way it is being rendered. It also runs inside [LottieGenTheme], where its scrollbar deliberately
 * overrides the shared theme's: this tool's scrollbars sit on panel chrome, not on Material
 * surfaces.
