 * an empty list matters: an empty list reads as a verdict about the folder, and someone who has just
 * picked the right one would be told it holds nothing.
 *
 * `internal` so it can be composed directly in a test: the state it represents is transient by
 * nature, and there is no seam to hold a real scan open long enough to catch it on screen without
 * racing it.
