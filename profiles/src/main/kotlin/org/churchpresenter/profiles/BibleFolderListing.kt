 * used to do both inline in its composition, on every open.
 *
 * Both halves come from the existing readers — [FileManager.getBibleFilesInDirectory] and
 * [bibleTitles] — so there is one implementation of each rule, not a second copy here. Renames are
 * deliberately *not* applied here: they cost no IO, so they are applied by the caller through
 * [BibleFolderListing.namesWith] instead of pinning this scan to the settings that hold them.
