/**
 * Fixtures for anything that reads a folder of Lottie animations.
 *
 * These outlived the Lower Third *settings* tab they were written for: that tab duplicated the Lower
 * Third content tab and was removed, but the Server tab's trigger list, the offscreen renderer, the
 * Bible tab's folder scan and the output screenshots all still need a folder with known contents in
 * it. Every test that needs files gets its **own temporary folder**, created and deleted around it,
 * so nothing leaks between tests or touches the developer's real animation library.
 *
 * A file counts as a Lottie animation when it is a `.json` whose text contains both a `"v"` and a
 * `"layers"` key — [lottieJson] produces the smallest thing that satisfies that, and
 * [NOT_LOTTIE_JSON] the smallest thing that does not.
