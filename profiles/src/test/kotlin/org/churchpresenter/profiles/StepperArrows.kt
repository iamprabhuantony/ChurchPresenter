/**
 * The increment/decrement arrows every `NumberSettingsTextField` publishes, shared by the settings
 * tab suites.
 *
 * These arrows used to lay out **zero pixels wide** on every tab — the component's text column held
 * a `fillMaxWidth()` child and carried no `weight`, so it took the whole row and left the 20dp arrow
 * column nothing. Three suites pinned that as present-but-unusable. The layout is fixed and they now
 * assert the opposite: that the arrows occupy space and that clicking one moves a value. Left as a
 * shared helper because the defect was in the shared control, so its regression guard belongs in one
 * place too — `NumberSettingsTextFieldTest` covers the component itself.

 * measured to nothing (a zone whose panel is collapsed, an output row for hardware that is absent).
 * Their fields measure `0x0` too, so an arrow of zero width there is the section being absent, not
 * the arrow collapsing — the defect this guards against took the arrows to zero while the field
 * beside them kept the whole row.
 *
 * Which field the click moves differs per tab and does not matter: what is asserted is that an arrow
 * click reaches a value at all, which the collapsed layout made impossible. The range clamp the
