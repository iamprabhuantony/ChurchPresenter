/**
 * `segmentedItemShape` rounds the outer corners of a segmented row so the buttons read as one
 * control: the first item is rounded on the left, the last on the right, anything between is square,
 * and a row of one is rounded all round.
 *
 * Every segmented row on the tab has two or three items, so the single-item case cannot be reached
 * by driving the UI — but it is the branch that decides whether a one-option row looks like a
 * button or like a fragment, so it is worth pinning. The function is a private top-level one, which
 * `AGENT.md` names as the case where reflection is the fallback rather than widening it to
 * `internal`; no production code is changed to support this test.
