/**
 * Covers the part of `uploadBackgroundToAtem` that runs before it goes near the network: reading the
 * chosen file.
 *
 * The upload as a whole needs a real switcher — `AtemClient.connect()` sends a UDP hello and waits
 * out its own connect timeout for a reply — so the tests here stop short of it. What they can reach
 * is the failure an operator actually hits: a background image that has been moved, deleted or is
 * not really an image. `ImageIO.read` returns null for all three and the upload has to fail with a
 * clear message rather than a `NullPointerException`, before any upload slot is reserved.
 *
 * The function is a private top-level `suspend` one, which `AGENT.md` names as the case where
 * reflection is the fallback rather than widening it; no production code is changed for this test.
