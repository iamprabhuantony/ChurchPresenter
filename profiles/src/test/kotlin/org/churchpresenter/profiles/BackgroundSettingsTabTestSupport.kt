/**
 * Harness and node locators shared by the `BackgroundSettingsTab` test classes.
 *
 * The tab is a **rail of six surfaces beside one editor**: the rail lists Default and Default Lower
 * Third, then a full-screen and a lower-third row under each of Bible and Songs, and the editor to
 * its right belongs to whichever row is selected. Only one surface's controls exist at a time, so a
 * test that wants to write to a surface selects it first — [openSurface] — and everything after
 * that addresses a single set of controls rather than one of six copies.
 *
 * Locating leans on **which column a node sits in**, because the rail and the editor deliberately
 * share words: "Full Screen" names two rail rows, "Default" names both a rail row and a type
 * segment, and "Color" is both a type segment and the caption above the colour field. [inRail] and
 * [inControls] cut a set of same-named nodes down by x-position, using the two column widths the
 * tab lays out with. Everything else is found by a value no other control holds.
 *
 * Known gaps — what these tests do not reach, and why. All are blocked by what the code does when
 * clicked, not by the tests being thin:
 *
 *  * **The file field** (`FileImagePicker`/`FileVideoPicker`) opens a **native** file chooser, which
 *    would block the run. Its displayed filename is asserted instead, so `onImagePathChange` /
 *    `onVideoPathChange` go uncovered with it.
 *  * **The two browse buttons** open `DialogWindow`s — real AWT windows — which throw
 *    `HeadlessException` under the suite's headless JVM. The Pexels/Pixabay API-key callbacks hang
 *    off those dialogs and are unreachable for the same reason. (The colour picker's dialog *is*
 *    driven: it uses the in-composition `Dialog`.)
 *  * **The ATEM upload buttons** open a TCP connection to the configured switcher, so
 *    `uploadBackgroundToAtem` and the button's busy/error states are not driven. Its one piece of
 *    pure logic, `coverCropArgb`, is tested in `CoverCropArgbTest`; the buttons' visibility rules
 *    are covered in `BackgroundSettingsTabPickerRowTest`.
 *  * **The stage preview's picture.** `BackgroundConfigFill` decodes off the main dispatcher and
 *    draws to a `Canvas`; there is no node to assert on. The preview's *arrangement* — which badge
 *    it shows and where the sample line sits — is covered in `BackgroundSettingsTabStructureTest`.
 *  * **Tooltip contents.** Every tooltip composes only after `TooltipArea`'s own 500 ms hover
 *    delay, which is the test's whole cost and is not injectable — `AGENT.md` says to note that
 *    rather than test it.
 *  * **The "(Install VLC)" branch.** The Video segment is disabled where VLC is absent, so a
 *    machine without it cannot pick Video at all. Video-dependent state is taken from a fixture
 *    rather than a click, which keeps the tests true on both kinds of machine.
