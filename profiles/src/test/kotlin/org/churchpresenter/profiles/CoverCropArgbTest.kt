/**
 * `coverCropArgb` prepares a background image for the ATEM media pool: it scales the source up or
 * down until it covers the switcher's frame on both axes, then crops the centred overflow. The point
 * is that the result fills the frame exactly without distorting the picture — a plain stretch to the
 * target size would squash a portrait photo into a 16:9 slot.
 *
 * It is a private top-level function, which `AGENT.md` names as the case where reflection is the
 * fallback rather than widening it to `internal`; no production code is changed for these tests.
 * Only the geometry is asserted — output size, which source pixels survive the crop, and which are
 * discarded — never interpolated colour values, which differ with the platform's rasteriser.
