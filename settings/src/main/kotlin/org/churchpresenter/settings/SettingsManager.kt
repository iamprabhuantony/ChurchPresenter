     * The raw-JSON migration steps, in the order they must be applied, each tagged with the schema
     * version it produces. A step only runs when the document's version is below its target, so a
     * file already at [CURRENT_SETTINGS_VERSION] is decoded without any rewriting at all — where
     * previously every step re-scanned the whole document on every single load.
     *
     * These are listed in the exact order the previous nested-call chain applied them, which is not
     * their chronological order — preserved verbatim so this rework changes no behaviour. Note one
     * pre-existing consequence of that order, left as-is rather than silently altered: version 1
     * rewrites entries *inside* `screenAssignments`, but version 2 is what creates that array from
     * the older `screen1-4Assignment` fields. A document old enough to still carry those numbered
     * fields therefore never gets its `showBible`/`showSongs` booleans converted. Such a document
     * is unlikely to exist (the booleans postdate the array), and reordering would change what
     * those users load, so the behaviour is documented rather than "fixed" on assumption.
     *
     * Versions 5 ([migrateHiddenTabs]) and 6 (the bible translation list) have no entry here — they
     * operate on the decoded object rather than the raw text, and so run separately in
     * [migrateAndDecode].
