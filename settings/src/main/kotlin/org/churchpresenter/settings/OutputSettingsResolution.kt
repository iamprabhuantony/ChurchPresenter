 * Resolving one output's own appearance against the global settings document.

 * diff, so that the existing settings tabs can edit one without knowing they are editing an
 * override. Only its *appearance* is ever read back: the library folder, the file list, the
 * translation stack and the browsing panels stay one per install, because an output holding its own
 * copy of those could point at a folder the operator has since moved, or present a translation the
 * Bible tab no longer lists.

/**
 * [override]'s appearance on top of this document's library, selection and panel state.
 *
 * The global stack decides *which* translations present and in what order; [override] supplies each
 * one's styling, matched by file name. A translation added to the stack after the override was made
 * has no styling there, and keeps the global styling rather than vanishing from the output.
 *
 * A translation's rename travels with the global entry rather than the override: what a translation
 * is *called* is one fact per install, like its file name, and the per-output settings surface does
 * not offer the field.
