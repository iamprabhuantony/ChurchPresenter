 * that action, and an action dropped from `ShortcutAction` decodes to an ignored map entry instead
 * of failing the whole settings load.
 *
 * Keyed by `ShortcutAction.name`. An entry mapped to an **empty list** is meaningful — it is the
 * user unbinding the action, which is not the same as having no entry at all.
