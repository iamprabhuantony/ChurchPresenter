/**
 * The Browser Source and NDI output lists, read and written.
 *
 * Extensions in their own file rather than members of [ProjectionSettings], because the two
 * families are the same four operations twice and putting them here keeps that visible — and keeps
 * the settings class itself about what is persisted rather than about how two of its lists are
 * indexed.
 *
 * Both lists are *virtual* outputs: unlike `screenAssignments` they are never reconciled against
 * detected hardware, so a slot exists exactly because an operator added one, and reading past the
 * end is a default rather than an error.
 */

/**
 * [assignment] at [index], growing the list with defaults if it is short.

 * The growth is what lets a settings row write slot 3 before slots 1 and 2 have ever been touched,
 * which is the ordinary case when an output is configured out of order.
