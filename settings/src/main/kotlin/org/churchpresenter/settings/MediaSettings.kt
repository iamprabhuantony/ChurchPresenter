/**
 * How the app-rendered subtitle overlay looks -- font, colour, size, backdrop and outline.
 *
 * Only applies to subtitles the app parses and draws itself (SRT/WebVTT sidecar files); an
 * embedded track or an `.ass`/`.ssa`/`.sub` file is still baked into the frame by VLC's own
 * renderer and unaffected by any of this. See `SubtitleCueParser`'s doc comment for why.
 *
 * Carried whole by each [OutputProfile] rather than once for the install, so two screens can style
 * their subtitles differently; [OutputProfileResolution] takes the profile's copy outright, with no
 * keep-list, because nothing here is install-wide. [OutputProfile.look]'s `media.subtitles` decides whether an
 * output draws them at all, and which *tracks* it draws is chosen on the Media tab, where the files
 * are loaded -- they belong to the video, not to the install.
