/**
 * Version 16: the title slide's song number getting a style of its own, where it shared the lyric
 * slides' one.
 *
 * The split is what #609 asked for -- the number small in a corner of every lyric slide and large at
 * the bottom of the title slide -- but the new record's defaults are the *stock* number's, not
 * whatever a church had configured. Without the seed, everyone who had ever restyled their number
 * would open this build to a title slide drawing stock styling, with nothing in settings to blame.
 *
 * The seed has three things worth pinning, each of which would be silent if wrong: it has to reach
 * inside **every profile** as well as the document, because a profile carries a whole `SongSettings`;
 * it has to pick the outline out of `outlines` rather than from beside the flat fields; and it has to
 * leave a document that already has the record alone.
