include(":composeApp")
// The converter: its own module, compiled and packaged separately, and depended on by
// :composeApp, which opens it in a window from the Help menu.
include(":converter")
// The song library: the grid view of every song in the library, opened from the Help menu beside
// the converter.
include(":songlibrary")
// The models the app and its screens share: what a song is, the `.song` file format, and the
// library folder it lives in. Depended on by :composeApp and :songlibrary, and by whatever screen
// is pulled out into a module of its own next.
include(":core-models")
// The Bitfocus Companion Satellite protocol client: a plain Kotlin library, depended on by
// :composeApp, which wraps it in CompanionSatelliteViewModel.
include(":companion-satellite")
include(":theme")
// The animated lower-third generator: its own module, compiled and packaged separately, and
// depended on by :composeApp, which opens it in a window from the Lower Third settings.
include(":lottieGenerator")
include(":bible-engine")
// The crossword puzzle authoring tool: its own module, not compiled into the app — a build-time
// task copies its encoded puzzles into :composeApp's resources.
include(":crossword")
// The presentation engine: PPTX/PPT/Keynote/PDF parsing, timing and animation. Its own module,
// depended on by :composeApp, which drives it from PresentationViewModel and CompanionServer.
include(":presentation-engine")
// Everything the app persists: the settings data classes, the SettingsManager that loads, migrates
// and saves settings.json, and the constants those defaults are spelled with.
include(":settings")
// Crash reporting and diagnostics: the crash log on disk and the Sentry forwarding behind it.
// Depended on by :composeApp and by every module that needs to report a fault.
include(":diagnostics")
// The Blackmagic ATEM protocol client: a plain Kotlin library speaking the switcher's UDP protocol
// — connect, state dump, upstream/downstream key, media-pool upload. Depended on by :composeApp,
// which wires it to settings and the lower third in AtemBridge.
include(":atem")
// The Planning Center Online client: the OAuth conversation, the Services REST calls and the
// loopback listener that catches the consent redirect. Depended on by :composeApp, which wraps it
// in PlanningCenterImportViewModel.
// NDI (Network Device Interface): the send half of Vizrt's IP video protocol, over the NDI Runtime
// the user installs separately — this module ships no NDI binaries. Plain Kotlin over JNA, with
// every native call behind one interface. Depended on by :composeApp, which wires it to settings
// and the presenters in NdiVideoRenderer.
include(":ndi")
// OMT (Open Media Transport): the open-source IP video protocol, both directions, over the libomt
// and libvmx the app bundles — both are MIT, so unlike NDI they ship inside the installer. Plain
// Kotlin over JNA, every native call behind one interface. Depended on by :composeApp, which wires
// it to settings and the presenters in OmtVideoRenderer and to the Canvas in OmtFrameCache.
include(":omt")
include(":planning-center")
// Bible formats: the .spb converters (USFX, Zefania XML, Beblia) and the catalogues the app
// downloads modules from. Depended on by :composeApp for the in-app browser and by :converter,
// which offers the same conversions from its own window.
include(":bible-formats")

// Song chords: the grammar a song's `[G]lyric` markup is written in — what counts as a chord, what
// counts as a section heading, transposition, and the chord-sheet import that produces the markup.
// Depended on by :composeApp and by :converter, which needs the same rule to write songs out.
include(":song-chords")

// The Bible itself: the loaded translation, its books, verses and search.
include(":bible")

// The Calendar Manager: the planner window that holds every planned service — the month grid, each
// day's services and their run of show — and writes them to `calendar.json` of its own, separate
// from settings and from any `.schedule` file. Depended on by :composeApp, which opens it from the
// Help menu beside the Song Library Manager and loads a planned service into the Schedule tab.
include(":calendar")

include(":strings")

include(":icons")

include(":shared-ui")

include(":slides")

include(":media")

// The Web tab and the embedded Chromium it and the output window browse with (JCEF). Depended on by
// :composeApp, which hands it the live output through WebOutput.
include(":web")

// The hidden Crossword tab and the decoder for the puzzles it plays. Not :crossword, which is the
// authoring tool and must stay out of the app; the puzzles reach this module by a build-time copy.
include(":crossword-tab")

// The Q&A tab and QAManager, the questions a congregation sends from their phones. Depended on by
// :composeApp, which hands it the live output through QAOutput and draws the remote dialog.
include(":qa")
include(":dictionary")
include(":stt")
include(":announcements")
include(":lower-third")

// The Songs tab, SongsViewModel and the song library on disk. Depended on by :composeApp, which
// hands it the song editor, the title slide, statistics and the Instance Link catalog.
include(":songs")

// The Bible tab, BibleViewModel, the cross references and the verse-sequence log. Depended on by
// :composeApp, which hands it the live output, the detection engine's status and statistics.
include(":bible-tab")

// The companion server and Instance Link: the Ktor REST/WebSocket API phones and other instances
// use, the tunnel, SSL and calendar sync. Depended on by :composeApp, which applies what remote
// clients ask for to the live output.
include(":server")

// The Companion Surface tab and CompanionSatelliteViewModel: the Compose face of
// :companion-satellite, which stays free of any UI toolkit. Depended on by :composeApp.
include(":companion-surface")
