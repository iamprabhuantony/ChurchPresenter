 * A download cannot be deleted when the app exits — the installer is launched as it does (see the
 * note on `deleteOnExit` in `UpdateAvailableDialog`), so the file is still in use. It is deleted on
 * the next launch instead, before any new download can start. Without this, every update leaves its
 * installer behind: macOS and Linux clear their temp directories on their own, Windows `%TEMP%`
 * does not.
 *
 * Only regular files named with [UPDATE_INSTALLER_PREFIX] are touched. One that cannot be deleted —
 * an `.msi` Windows still has locked — is left for the next launch, and nothing here throws.
