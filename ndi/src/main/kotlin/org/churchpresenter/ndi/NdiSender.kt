/**
 * One NDI source on the network: the fill, and the key beside it when the mode asks for one.
 *
 * Owns the pixel conversion, both native handles and the reused byte buffers, so a caller hands it
 * packed ARGB — what every renderer in this app already has — and nothing else. It is deliberately
 * ignorant of settings, of Compose and of what is being presented: it is given a frame and a name.
 *
 * **Not thread-safe.** Each instance is driven by exactly one render pump, which is what makes the
 * reused buffers safe. Two threads sending through one sender would tear a frame.
 *
 * [keyName] follows the convention hardware and software receivers already expect — the fill's name
 * with a " Key" suffix — so an operator picking the pair in OBS sees them adjacent and obviously
 * related, rather than as two unrelated sources.
