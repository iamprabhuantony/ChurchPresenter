/**
 * An **opt-in manual harness** that binds the real NDI Runtime, rather than [FakeNdiLibrary]. It is
 * not part of the ordinary suite and does nothing unless explicitly asked for:
 *
 * ```
 * ./gradlew :ndi:test -PndiHardware=true --tests '*NdiHardwareTest*'
 * ```
 *
 * **Why it is gated rather than merely self-skipping.** Everything below has effects a routine
 * `check` must not have: it loads a 30 MB native library, brings up the runtime's own threads, and
 * — the part that leaves the machine — **advertises a source that every NDI receiver on the LAN can
 * discover**. On a machine mid-service that is a stray source appearing in the operator's list.
 * It also costs far more than the ~1s per-test bar the suite is held to.
 *
 * **What it is actually for.** The rest of this module is tested against a fake, which proves the
 * logic but cannot prove the *binding*: that `libndi` exports the flat C symbols [NdiLibC] declares,
 * that [NdiSendCreateStruct], [NdiVideoFrameStruct], [NdiFindCreateStruct], [NdiSourceStruct] and
 * [NdiRecvCreateStruct] match the SDK's ABI field-for-field, and that the FourCC values are the
 * ones a receiver accepts. Those are the assumptions that fail silently —
 * a wrong struct layout is not a compile error and not an exception, it is a wrong picture — and
 * this is the only thing that can check them.
 *
 * It deliberately does **not** assert that a receiver saw anything: that needs a second machine, or
 * NDI Studio Monitor running beside it. What it proves is that every call this app makes reaches the
 * runtime and comes back sane.
