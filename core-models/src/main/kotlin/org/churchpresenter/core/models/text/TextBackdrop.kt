/**
 * What is drawn *behind* and *around* a piece of styled text, alongside the bold/italic/underline
 * quartet that styles the glyphs themselves.
 *
 * Two independent things, kept in one record because they are edited together and every element
 * that can have one can have the other:
 *
 *  * **The line background** — a filled band behind each wrapped line, as wide as that line's own
 *    text. It is what makes lyrics readable over a busy photo without dimming the whole picture.
 *    [lineBackgroundHeight] grows the band above and below the line box; [lineBackgroundOffset]
 *    slides it down (negative: up), which is how a band is centred on a face whose glyphs do not
 *    sit centred in their own line box.
 *  * **The border** — one box around the whole block, [borderPadding] away from the text on every
 *    side.
 *
 * With **both** on they stop being two drawings and become one: the box is filled as well as
 * stroked, so the fill is the block's shape rather than a band per line. A stack of outlined bands
 * is not a look anybody sets out to produce — the strokes of one line run through the line above
 * it. The renderer decides that; here they are still just two flags.
 *
 * Both carry their own opacity rather than an alpha in the colour: the colour picker these fields
 * are edited with produces opaque `#RRGGBB`, so a translucent band needs a number of its own —
 * exactly as the shadow settings beside them already do.
 *
 * The measurements are in the same units the element's font size is in, so they scale with the type
 * when the presenter fits it to an output: a band set against a 1080p screen still frames the text
 * on a 4K one.
