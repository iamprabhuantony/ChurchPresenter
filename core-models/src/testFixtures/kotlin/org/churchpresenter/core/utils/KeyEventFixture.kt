/**
 * A key-down event, for testing binding resolution without composing anything.
 *
 * Uses Compose desktop's own `KeyEvent` factory rather than wrapping a `java.awt.event.KeyEvent`:
 * a desktop `KeyEvent` is an `InternalKeyEvent`, not the AWT one, so handing it an AWT event throws
 * `ClassCastException` the moment anything reads `.key` off it.
 *
 * The factory is `@InternalComposeUiApi`, opted into here because there is no public way to build a
 * `KeyEvent` outside a composition and the alternative is to spin up a Compose host for assertions
 * that are pure logic. It is confined to this one test fixture, so a Compose upgrade that changes
 * the signature breaks one file rather than every keyboard test.
