/**
 * Minimal ATEM switcher UDP client for uploading stills and clips to the media pool.
 *
 * Implements a subset of the Blackmagic ATEM protocol (port 9910) sufficient for:
 *   - Connecting (hello handshake)
 *   - Reading video mode (FPS) and media pool slot info from the ATEM state dump
 *   - Uploading a still (single ARGB frame) to the still store
 *   - Uploading a clip (list of ARGB frames) to the clip store
 *
 * Input pixel format: ARGB ints — converted internally to the ATEM's native
 * 10-bit YUVA 4:2:2 media pool format (BT.709 for >=720p, BT.601 below).
 *
 * Upload flow (per sofie-atem-connection, https://github.com/nrkno/sofie-atem-connection):
 *   LOCK(store, 1) → LKOB                              lock the media pool store
 *   FTSD(transferId, store, index, size, mode=1)       request the upload
 *   ← FTCD(transferId, chunkSize, chunkCount)          ATEM grants a batch of chunks
 *   FTFD(transferId, name, md5) once + FTDa chunks     description, then granted data chunks
 *   …more FTCD grants / FTDa batches until all sent…
 *   ← FTDC(transferId)                                 transfer complete
 *   LOCK(store, 0)                                     unlock
 * FTDE(transferId, code) is the error response; code 1 means "please retry".
 * Clips additionally send CMPC (clear clip) before and SMPC (set name/frames) after,
 * and use store id = clipIndex + 1 (store 0 is the still pool).
 *
 * Packet header (12 bytes):
 *   byte 0   : (flags shl 3) or ((totalLength shr 8) and 0x07)
 *   byte 1   : totalLength and 0xFF
 *   bytes 2-3: sessionId (big-endian uint16) — assigned by ATEM on connect
 *   bytes 4-5: lastRemotePacketId (big-endian uint16) — ATEM's most recent packet ID, for ACK
 *   bytes 6-7: ackPacketId (big-endian uint16) — usually 0
 *   bytes 8-9: unknown (usually 0)
 *   bytes 10-11: packetId (big-endian uint16, wraps at 0x8000) — sender's sequence number
 *
 * Flag bit values (before left-shift-3):
 *   0x01 = AckRequest         — receiver must ACK this packet
 *   0x02 = Hello/NewSessionId — connection handshake
 *   0x08 = RetransmitRequest  — receiver asks for packets to be resent (from id at bytes 6-7)
 *   0x10 = AckReply           — pure ACK; acked packet id at bytes 4-5
 *
 * The real session id is NOT in the hello response — the ATEM assigns it in its first
 * post-handshake packet, so it is re-read from every incoming packet.
