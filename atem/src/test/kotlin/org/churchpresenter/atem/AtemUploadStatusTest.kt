/**
 * The single shared progress bar for ATEM media uploads.
 *
 * One [AtemUploadStatus] is observed by the Lower Third tab, but two uploads can overlap — the
 * companion API can start a second while the in-app one is still transferring. Every mutator is
 * therefore gated on the upload id returned by [begin]: a late [progress]/[complete]/[fail]/[clear]
 * from the OLDER upload must not touch the newer upload's bar, or the operator sees the wrong name,
 * a bar that jumps backwards, or a bar that clears while an upload is still running.
 *
 * State is a plain StateFlow read synchronously via `.value`, so these assertions need no waiting.
 * The object is a JVM singleton; each test calls [begin] first, which replaces the state outright,
 * so tests don't leak into one another.
