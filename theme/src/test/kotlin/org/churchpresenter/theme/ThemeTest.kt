/**
 * The nine colour schemes behind the theme picker, checked as data rather than as pixels.
 *
 * Each scheme is written out by hand, twenty-odd colours at a time, and the ones that go wrong go
 * wrong quietly: a foreground copied from the wrong scheme leaves text the same colour as what it
 * sits on, which no compiler notices and nobody sees until that theme is selected during a service.
 * These tests read the schemes directly and assert the two properties that make a theme usable —
 * text stands out from what it is drawn on, and a light theme is actually light.
 *
 * The schemes are private top-level values, so they are reached by reflection on their file class;
 * the mapping from [ThemeMode] to scheme is duplicated here on purpose, because pinning "MIDNIGHT
 * is a dark theme" is precisely the point.
 *
 * `ChurchPresenterTheme` itself is a composable and needs a composition to run, so it is not
 * covered here.
