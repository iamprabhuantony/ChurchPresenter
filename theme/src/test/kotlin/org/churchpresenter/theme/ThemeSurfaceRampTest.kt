/**
 * That every theme's settings screens stay readable as three distinct layers (issue #95).
 *
 * A settings tab paints its page with `surfaceVariant`, puts `SettingsSection` cards on it in
 * `surfaceContainer`, and puts `SettingsTextField` inputs on those cards in `surfaceContainerHigh`.
 * If two of the three land on the same tone, the layer between them stops reading as a layer: a card
 * becomes a flat region of page, or a field becomes a hole in a card with only a 1dp border to say
 * otherwise — and in several themes `outlineVariant` equals `surfaceVariant`, so even the border can
 * disappear.
 *
 * That is what went wrong before: no scheme declared the container roles, so both came from the M3
 * baseline rather than the theme, and in the Studio theme the card came out at exactly the luminance
 * of its own page. Since the tones are now chosen per theme, they need something holding them apart —
 * every theme, not just the two anyone happens to open.
 *
 * The bar is deliberately low. These are adjacent tones on one ramp, not text on a background, so
 * WCAG's 4.5:1 does not apply; what matters is that the step is present and above the ~1.1:1 where an
 * edge stops being visible on a projector-lit booth monitor. Body text against the field is held to
 * the real contrast bar separately below.
