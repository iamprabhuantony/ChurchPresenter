/**
 * Which Companion surface the tab shows, and what happens to that choice when the surfaces change
 * underneath it.
 *
 * The tab is a chooser over the connections marked "show in tab" and nothing else, so its whole job
 * is picking one. Three of those decisions are only visible here: a connection the operator did not
 * mark for the tab must not appear even though it is configured and connected; a single surface must
 * not be wrapped in a one-item chooser; and — the one that has teeth — a surface removed in Settings
 * while it is the one on screen has to fall back to another rather than leaving the tab pointed at a
 * connection that no longer exists.
 *
 * Surfaces are told apart by seeding a differently-labelled button into each one's grid, which is
 * the view model's own live list, so no socket is involved for the grid itself.
 *
 * The satellite client's constructor is stubbed for the same reason as
 * [CompanionSurfacePanelTest] — and the stub is
 * load-bearing, not defensive: without it, selecting a surface opens a real connection to the
 * configured host and the suite hangs rather than failing. That was checked by removing it.
 *
 * Cost note: MockK instruments the client class once per JVM, which lands on whichever test in this
 * class runs first (~1.5s). It is one-off instrumentation rather than a wait, and it is shared with
 * `CompanionSurfacePanelTest` when both run — but in a `tabs`-only run this class pays it alone, so
 * the slowest `time=` here is not a per-test cost anyone can remove by rewriting the test.
