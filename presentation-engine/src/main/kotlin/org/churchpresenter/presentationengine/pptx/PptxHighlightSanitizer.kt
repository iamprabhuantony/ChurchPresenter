/**
 * Removes `<a:highlight>` elements that carry any colour form other than `<a:srgbClr>`.
 *
 * POI reads a run's highlight as `getHighlight().getSrgbClr()` and passes the result straight to
 * `DrawPaint.applyColorTransform` without a null check (`XSLFTextRun.fetchHighlightColor`), so a
 * highlight written as a scheme, preset, system or HSL colour — all legal in the schema, and what
 * PowerPoint writes for a theme-coloured text highlight — throws
 * `NullPointerException: … because "rgbCol" is null` from inside `DrawTextParagraph`. That kills
 * the whole slide render, not just the highlight: nothing on the slide is drawn.
 *
 * Dropping the element loses the highlight's background wash on those runs and keeps everything
 * else on the slide. Resolving a scheme colour ourselves would need the theme the fetcher was
 * about to consult, and there is no POI entry point that returns it for a highlight — so the
 * faithful-looking option is not available, while a blank slide is the alternative.
