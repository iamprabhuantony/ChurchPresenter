/**
 * What the tunnel does with a running `cloudflared`: scraping the public URL out of its output, and
 * what each way the process can end means to the operator.
 *
 * No download and no real tunnel. `TunnelManager` resolves `~/.churchpresenter/cloudflared` at
 * construction and skips the download when that file already exists and `cloudflared.version` beside
 * it names the pinned release, so a shell script written there with that marker before the manager is
 * built *is* the binary as far as production code is concerned — the real
 * `ProcessBuilder`, the real reader loop and the real state transitions all run.
 *
 * The three endings are what matter, and only one of them is a failure the operator caused: a
 * process that prints a URL and then dies is a tunnel that **dropped** (Cloudflare hung up, the
 * network went), while one that dies without ever printing a URL never started at all. Reporting
 * either as the other sends someone to debug the wrong end of the connection, and this is the
 * feature people fall back on when the church WiFi will not route.
 *
 * Windows is skipped: the binary is `cloudflared.exe` there and a shell script cannot stand in for
 * it. The pure decisions are covered on every platform by [TunnelManagerTest].
 *
 * Not covered: the download path (it fetches from GitHub, and the URL is not injectable), the
 * macOS-only `tar` extraction that follows it, and the 30-second no-URL timeout — a wait that can
 * only end by expiring.
