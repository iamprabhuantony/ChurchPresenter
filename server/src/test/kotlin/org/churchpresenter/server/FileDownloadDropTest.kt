/**
 * What happens when a follower or a phone abandons a file download half way.
 *
 * The reported case was an 11 MB Bible module served to an Instance Link follower: the response
 * ended with none of it written, Ktor raised `BodyLengthIsTooSmall`, and because nothing caught it
 * the call went through `StatusPages` — which tried to write an error body into a response whose
 * headers were already on the wire — and was reported as a server fault. A download that stops
 * because the other end left is not a fault of this server's, and there is nothing left to send.
 *
 * The real abort cannot be staged here without racing a socket, so the rule is exercised at the
 * step that decides: the send itself is the parameter.
