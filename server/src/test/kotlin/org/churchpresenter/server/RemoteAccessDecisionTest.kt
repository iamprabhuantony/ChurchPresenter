/**
 * Whether a remote request runs, is refused, or goes to the operator.
 *
 * This is the gate between any phone on the church WiFi and the live output. It was written out
 * seven times across `main.kt`'s request collectors — in two spellings, since some copies split the
 * block checks and others fused them — with no tests on any of them.
 *
 * The two properties worth pinning are both about what happens when the lists disagree or the device
 * is unknown, which is exactly where seven hand-written copies were free to drift.
 *
 * Plain sets, no fixtures: the function takes collections rather than `RemoteClientManager`
 * precisely so a test never touches `~/.churchpresenter/remote_clients.json`.
