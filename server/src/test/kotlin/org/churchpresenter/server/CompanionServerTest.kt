/**
 * The mobile-companion / Instance Link server, exercised against a REAL running instance.
 *
 * `CompanionServer.start()` builds its own Netty server rather than exposing a separable Ktor
 * module, so Ktor's `testApplication` harness can't reach it without a production refactor.
 * Starting it on a free port and driving it over real HTTP/WebSocket tests the same pipeline a
 * phone or a follower instance actually talks to — including the connect snapshot, which is the
 * source of a whole class of "follower shows stale content" bugs.
 *
 * Not covered, deliberately: that a session which dies *during* its snapshot still releases its
 * broadcast collector. The collector is launched before the snapshot so nothing emitted meanwhile is
 * lost, which puts it outside the handler's own `try`/`finally` — it is cancelled from the session
 * job's completion instead. Reaching that path means making a snapshot `send` fail, and the only
 * lever a test has is closing the client early, which races the snapshot rather than landing inside
 * it: sometimes the frames are already buffered and nothing throws. A test that only sometimes
 * exercises what it claims to is worse than this note.
