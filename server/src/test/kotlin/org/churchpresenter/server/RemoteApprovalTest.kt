/**
 * What an approval-only remote request turns into: a refusal, a toast after the fact, or a prompt.
 *
 * Pairs with [RemoteAccessDecisionTest], which covers *whether* a device is trusted. This covers what
 * that verdict means for the request. The two were written out by hand together in eight handlers in
 * `main.kt`, all at 0% coverage.
 *
 * The property worth having a test for is the last one here: `RemoteActivityNotification` and
 * `RemoteEvent` carry **identical fields**, and each handler used to build one in its approve branch
 * and the other in its prompt branch, separately, from the same values. Nothing stopped the toast and
 * the approval dialog describing the same request differently — a drift no compiler and no type
 * checker would catch, and one an operator would only notice mid-service.
