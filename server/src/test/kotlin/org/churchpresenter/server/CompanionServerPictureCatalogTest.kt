/**
 * `GET /api/pictures` — the folder the desktop currently has open, which is what a phone asks for
 * when it opens its Pictures tab with no folder id to go on.
 *
 * **Its two siblings were covered and this one was not**, which is why it is worth its own suite.
 * `/api/pictures/{id}` and `/api/pictures/{id}/images/{index}` each have their key gate, their 404s
 * and their success path asserted elsewhere; the unparameterised route had none of the three. It is
 * also the only one of the three that can answer *"there is nothing to show yet"*, because it is the
 * only one not addressed by an id the caller already holds.
 *
 * **One shared server, plus a throwaway one for the empty case.** `CompanionServer` exposes no way
 * to *unload* a picture folder — `updatePictures` only ever sets it — so on the shared server the
 * "no folder open" case would depend on running before the others. That is the execution-order
 * dependency the project's test rules call out, so that one test stands up its own server instead
 * of assuming an order. The other two share the class's, because starting a Ktor engine is the
 * whole cost here (~1s) and neither of them needs a clean one.
