/**
 * One emitted delta: a PNG-encoded sub-rectangle of the full [fullWidth]x[fullHeight] frame,
 * positioned at ([x], [y]). A full-frame delta has x=0, y=0, rectWidth=fullWidth,
 * rectHeight=fullHeight — sent for the very first tick and whenever a new HTTP subscriber
 * attaches, since a brand-new client's compositing canvas has nothing to apply a partial rect
 * onto yet. Note: default `equals()`/`hashCode()` on [png] is reference-based, not content-based
 * — harmless since nothing ever compares instances, only passes them through.
