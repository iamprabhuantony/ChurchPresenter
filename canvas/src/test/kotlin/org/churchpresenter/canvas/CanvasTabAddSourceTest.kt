/**
 * Every type the Add-source menu offers, and what each one actually adds.
 *
 * [CanvasTabTest] covers three of the eleven (text, image, clock) and the fact that a source lands in
 * the current scene at all. The rest were never driven — and they are exactly where a wiring mistake
 * hides, because every entry looks alike at the call site: one menu item, one `addSource` with a
 * different `SceneSource` subclass and a different default rectangle.
 *
 * A menu entry bound to the wrong subclass gives the operator a text box when they asked for a QR
 * code, and nothing about the menu would look wrong. So each test asserts the **type**, not just
 * that something appeared.
 *
 * One source per test, deliberately: the add button cannot be driven twice in a single test (see
 * `addSourceOfType`).
