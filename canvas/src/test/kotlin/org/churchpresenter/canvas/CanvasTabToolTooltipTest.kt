/**
 * The drawing toolbar's tooltips — which are the **only** name those buttons have.
 *
 * Each tool is an `IconButton` whose entire visible content is one glyph (`◆`, `□`, `○`, `∕`, `→`,
 * `✎`). Nothing else on screen says which is which, and the glyphs for line and freehand in
 * particular are not self-explanatory, so a tooltip that stopped drawing would leave an operator
 * guessing at six identical-looking buttons rather than merely losing a convenience.
 *
 * Assertions are **differential** — a count before the hover against a count after. Unlike most
 * tooltips these names appear nowhere else, so a bare `assertExists` would in fact detect them; the
 * differential form is kept anyway because it also proves the tooltip belongs to *the button that
 * was hovered*, which is the part that would break if the loop that builds them lost its binding.
 *
 * The glyph is what a test can address the button by, and that is a symptom rather than a
 * convenience: `AGENT.md` forbids text-as-icon (`Text("⏸")`) precisely here. Reported with the PR;
 * not changed by it, since real icon assets are a production change of their own.
