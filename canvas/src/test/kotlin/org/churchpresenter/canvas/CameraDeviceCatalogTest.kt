 * Whether a stored camera may be opened on this machine.

 * The rule this pins is that a **path is not an identity**. A `.song` file and a settings export
 * both travel, and `avfoundation://0` written on one machine names a camera on the next one too —
 * a different camera, pointed somewhere else in the room. Opening it would put the wrong picture
 * behind the lyrics, which is worse than showing nothing, so the match is on the name.
