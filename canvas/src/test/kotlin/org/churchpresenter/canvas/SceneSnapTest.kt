/**
 * The scene-canvas drag snapping — how a dragged source clicks onto the canvas guides (left/centre/
 * right, top/centre/bottom) and onto other sources' edges within the snap threshold. Coordinates are
 * normalised 0..1 and the threshold is 6px / canvas size, so at 1000px the window to snap is 0.006.
 * A wrong result snaps to the wrong guide or fails to snap; the guides, the threshold edge, the
 * source targets, and the exclude/invisible rules are pinned here.
