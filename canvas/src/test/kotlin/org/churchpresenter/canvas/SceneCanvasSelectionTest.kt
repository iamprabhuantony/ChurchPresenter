/**
 * Selecting and moving a source on the canvas with the select tool.
 *
 * These are the two gestures the canvas exists for. Which source a click selects decides what every
 * control in the properties panel then edits, and a drag has to move the source the operator grabbed
 * — by the distance they dragged — while the snap logic pulls it onto the guides. A source that is
 * locked, or invisible, must ignore both.
 *
 * The canvas is 400dp wide at 16:9, so it lays out 400 x 225 and a normalised coordinate maps to
 * pixels by multiplying by those — confirmed by `SceneCanvasDrawingTest`, which reads the same
 * mapping back out of a drag. Sources publish no test tag, so they are addressed by pressing at a
 * position inside their bounds: they are descendants of the canvas node and hit-testing routes the
 * event to the topmost one, which is exactly what a real click does.
 *
 * **Not covered: the rotation handle.** It is drawn at a `.offset(...)` outside the source's own
 * bounds and sized 12dp, so addressing it means reproducing the handle-placement arithmetic in the
 * test to find out where it landed — an assertion about the test's own maths rather than the
 * production code's. Its angle computation is worth covering through a seam if one is ever extracted.
