/**
 * What survives a recomposition the operator did not ask for.
 *
 * The panel lives inside the canvas tab, so it is re-invoked whenever anything around it changes —
 * the dialog is resized, a setting elsewhere is edited, the tab re-lays out. None of that is a change
 * to the source being edited, and none of it may disturb what the panel is showing. That matters
 * most for the state the panel keeps *outside* the source: the local text a numeric field holds
 * before it is committed, and a countdown's running timer. Losing either mid-service is a real
 * failure — a duration being typed silently reverting, a timer resetting itself.
 *
 * [redrawablePanel] reproduces that by handing the panel a new `Modifier` on each redraw and leaving
 * the source untouched, which is precisely how its real caller behaves.
