/**
 * Re-finding a saved AVFoundation camera when the index it was saved at no longer holds it.
 *
 * AVFoundation addresses a device by its position in one listing that also contains virtual
 * cameras and the machine's own displays. Virtual cameras register when their host app starts, so
 * that listing is a different length at different moments — a real reporter's Mac was seen
 * alternating between five and six entries minutes apart. A stored index is therefore a snapshot,
 * and the device at it can become a *different camera* or `Capture screen 0`, whose picture is the
 * operator's display: opening that is a screen recording, which is why macOS asked that reporter
 * for Screen Recording permission on every launch (issue #478).
 *
 * The fixtures below are that machine's real listing, from the reporter's own terminal output in
 * issue #431, and are driven through the production parser rather than hand-built device lists.
