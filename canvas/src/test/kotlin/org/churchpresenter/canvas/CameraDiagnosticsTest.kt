/**
 * The decisions the camera capture loop makes about a failure, tested as the pure functions they
 * are: classifying ffmpeg's stderr, reading what the device says it accepts, choosing the next
 * attempt, and redacting what goes to Sentry.
 *
 * The fixtures are real ffmpeg output. Two of these shapes — a device refusing the pixel format,
 * and macOS refusing on privacy grounds — are what issue #431 turned out to be about, and the app
 * could not tell them apart because it printed the answer to a `System.err` that a packaged `.app`
 * discards.
 *
 * Not covered here, because each needs a real process, a real device or a signed bundle: the
 * stderr drain, the retry loop that consumes these decisions, the `CrashReporter` call, and the
 * macOS entitlements. That is the deliberate split — the decisions are pure and tested, and the one
 * unreachable step (`ProcessBuilder.start()`) stays uncovered.
