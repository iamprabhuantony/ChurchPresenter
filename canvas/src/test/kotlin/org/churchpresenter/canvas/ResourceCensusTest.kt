/**
 * The high-water marks of the native resources the app holds on someone else's behalf.
 *
 * Three leaks were found in this area in one week — an ffmpeg process holding a camera, a libvlc
 * decoder, and a headless browser leaked on every viewport resize — and every one of them leaks a
 * process or a native handle rather than heap. That is why the signal watched here is a count and
 * not memory: a JVM heap chart was flat through all three.
 *
 * [ResourceCensus] is process-global and the suite shares a JVM, so every test resets it.
