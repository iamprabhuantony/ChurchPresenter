/**
 * The NDI panel's decisions, and what it shows on a machine with no NDI Runtime.
 *
 * The dropdown's contents are the network — no fixture can put a sender on it — so what the panel
 * *offers* is taken as functions and driven directly here. Both are about a source configured
 * somewhere else: a scene built in the booth and opened on a laptop, or a camera switched off
 * between services. Whether the panel still names it is the difference between an operator seeing
 * that their source is missing and being shown a blank picker for a layer that is configured.
