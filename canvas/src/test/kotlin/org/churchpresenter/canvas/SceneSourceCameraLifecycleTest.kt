/**
 * What a camera source costs the capture cache as it comes and goes from a composition.
 *
 * **Why this can be tested at all**, when `SceneSourceRendererTest` says the camera branch needs
 * real hardware: the device path here names a scheme `buildFfmpegCommand` has no branch for, so
 * `runFfmpegCapture` returns at its first line and no process is ever started. The cache entry is
 * still created and still has to be released, which is the whole of what these tests are about.
 *
 * They exist because the release path had drifted from the acquire path. `acquire` was called from
 * a `remember` block and released from a `DisposableEffect`, and those are not the same lifecycle:
 * a composition that is abandoned before its effects run discards what `remember` produced without
 * calling any `onDispose`. The leaked entry owns an ffmpeg process holding the device open, so the
 * next acquire of that camera fails with `device_busy` — reported from the field as a canvas gone
 * black on a camera nothing else was using.
 *
 * Not covered: the abandonment itself, which needs a composition to be started and thrown away
 * mid-frame and has no hook in `runComposeUiTest`. What is pinned here is the invariant that made
 * it a leak — acquire and release keyed and scoped alike, balanced over an ordinary mount and
 * unmount.
