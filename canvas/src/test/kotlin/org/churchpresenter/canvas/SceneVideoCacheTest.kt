/**
 * That one video file costs one decode, however many layers draw it.
 *
 * The most expensive of the three shared caches. A video layer is composed in the canvas editor, in
 * every sidebar live preview and on every presenter output, and each instance used to build its own
 * VLC factory, its own player and its own conversion loop — the same file decoded at full source
 * resolution that many times, its audio played that many times over itself, and every frame
 * converted to an `ImageBitmap` per instance at 60fps.
 *
 * libvlc is never loaded here: the cache takes its player as a constructor parameter and these
 * tests supply a stand-in that hands back frames on demand. So this measures the sharing, the
 * release and the volume path, not the decoder.
