 * every Mac and returned nothing every time, which is why the Video Format menu only ever offered
 * "Auto", and why the "choose a specific one under Video Format" the unsupported-format error tells
 * the operator to do pointed at an empty menu.
 *
 * A camera constrained to a fixed set of modes answers `1x1` by refusing it and printing
 * `Supported modes:` followed by every mode it has. A screen-capture pseudo-device instead accepts
 * any size and reports nothing — correctly, since it has no mode list to give.
 *
 * **No output file is named on purpose.** ffmpeg opens the input, discovers it has nowhere to write,
 * says `At least one output file must be specified` and exits — measured at 0.34s — so the probe
 * cannot turn into a capture session that never ends.

 * The Mac's cameras, preferring ffmpeg's listing outright over `system_profiler`'s.
 *
 * **These two tools do not share an index space, so their results must never be merged.** ffmpeg
 * enumerates everything AVFoundation will open and prints the index needed to open it;
 * `system_profiler` enumerates physical hardware and prints no index at all. Numbering the latter
 * by position invents an address, and an invented address opens the wrong device rather than
 * failing — see [avfoundationCamerasFrom].
 *
 * `system_profiler` is therefore only a fallback for when ffmpeg listed nothing. Capture needs ffmpeg
 * whatever named the device, so those entries can never be opened; they exist so the operator sees
 * their camera named beside a hint explaining that, rather than an empty list.
 *
 * Since the app ships ffmpeg, reaching this on a Mac most often means AVFoundation enumerated
 * nothing — and the usual cause of that is a privacy refusal, which is what makes the camera
 * privacy button beside this picker the useful thing on screen. The accompanying sentence is
 * `canvas_camera_unopenable_listing`; this doc used to name `canvas_camera_ffmpeg_hint`, which was
 * superseded and is kept defined only so fourteen locales' translations are not orphaned.
