/**
 * Singleton that holds countdown timer runtime state (remainingSeconds, isRunning)
 * keyed by ClockSource ID, so both the canvas renderer and the properties panel
 * share the same live state.
 *
 * A count-up source is held here too, and stores its elapsed seconds in the same
 * [TimerState.remainingSeconds] field — it is seeded at zero and counted up instead of down.
 *
 * **The clock that advances a timer lives here, not in the renderer.** A scene is composed in
 * several places at once — the canvas editor, the live preview, every output window — and while
 * each of those drove its own one-second loop against this shared state they all advanced the same
 * timer, so it ran at one second per *renderer* per second: a stopwatch climbing five at a time,
 * and a countdown whose direction depended on which renderers happened to be showing which mode.
 * One ticker per source, started by [setRunning], cannot do that whatever is on screen.
