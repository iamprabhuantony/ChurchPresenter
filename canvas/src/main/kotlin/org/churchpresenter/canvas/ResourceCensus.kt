 * week — a leaked ffmpeg process holding a camera, a leaked libvlc decoder, and a leaked headless
 * browser on every viewport resize. All three leak a *process or a native handle*, so a heap gauge
 * stays flat through all of them, and CPU is no better: a busy canvas legitimately costs a lot, and
 * without a per-machine baseline "expensive" and "three times more expensive than it should be" look
 * identical.
 *
 * What all three have in common is a count that goes up and does not come down. That is cheap to
 * watch, carries nothing about the operator, and is specific to the failure this app actually has.
 *
 * The peak is recorded rather than the live value because the moment of shutdown is not when a leak
 * is visible — a leak is visible in how high the count climbed while the service ran.
