/**
 * The eBible catalogue's cache lifecycle: what is served from memory, what is served from disk, and
 * what goes back to the network.
 *
 * The catalogue is a 1,500-row CSV fetched over the internet, and a hall with a slow line should not
 * pay for it twice in one session — nor should a hall with no line at all lose the list it saw last
 * time. Both caches are checked before the fetch, so the order matters and is asserted here by
 * counting requests rather than by timing anything: `fetchCatalog` takes its clock as a parameter,
 * so a TTL expiry is arithmetic and the suite never waits.
