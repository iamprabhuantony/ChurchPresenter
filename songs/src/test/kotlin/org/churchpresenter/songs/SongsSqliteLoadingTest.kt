/**
 * Reading a `.sps` songbook that is really a SQLite database.
 *
 * The Mac build of SongPresenter saves its songbooks as SQLite under the same `.sps` extension the
 * Windows build uses for a delimited text file, so the loader cannot go by the name — it sniffs the
 * first sixteen bytes for the `SQLite format 3` magic and takes a different path entirely. Both
 * paths are reached by the same call from the songs tab, and the failure when the sniff is wrong is
 * not an error message: the file parses as text, no line has enough fields, and the songbook loads
 * as empty.
 *
 * The lyrics differ too. The text format packs a whole song into one field with `@$`/`@%` markers
 * and the loader rebuilds a running order from it (see [SongsTest]); the SQLite format already has
 * real newlines, so lines are kept exactly as written and only the section headings are wrapped —
 * which means the chorus is NOT lifted out and repeated here. That difference is pinned below.
