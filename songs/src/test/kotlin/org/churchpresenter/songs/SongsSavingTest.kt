/**
 * Writing an edited song back to the songbook it came from.
 *
 * The song editor hands [Songs.saveSongToFile] the song as it was and as it now is, and the file it
 * belongs to has to be found again from those two alone. A song from a `.song` file knows its own
 * path; a song from a legacy `.sps` songbook does not, so every `.sps` file in the library folder is
 * opened in turn and searched for a line whose number and title still match the ORIGINAL — which is
 * why the original is passed at all, and why renaming and renumbering in one edit still lands.
 *
 * Getting this wrong is quiet: the editor closes, the library shows the edit, and the file on disk
 * is unchanged — so the song reverts at the next restart, usually noticed during a service. The
 * other direction is worse, since the rewrite replaces the whole line: a lyric that does not
 * survive the round trip back into the `@$`/`@%` markers is lost with no way back.
