/**
 * Clicking a song in the schedule, and what the Songs tab does about it.
 *
 * The schedule is where a service is driven from, so this is the ordinary way a song is put on
 * screen: the operator clicks the row, the tab finds that song in the library and hands its first
 * section to the presenter. Getting it wrong is quiet — the row highlights, and nothing reaches the
 * output.
 *
 * Two details of the wiring are the reason this is worth pinning:
 *
 * - The row can be clicked **before the library has finished loading**, which is normal on a cold
 *   start. The tab waits for the load rather than looking the song up in an empty catalogue and
 *   giving up.
 * - The same row can be clicked **twice**. Compose would skip the second, so the caller bumps a
 *   version alongside the item; without it, taking a song live, moving away and coming back to the
 *   same row would do nothing the second time.
