/**
 * Finding a song in the Songs tab.
 *
 * This is the tab's whole job during a service: an operator with a number called from the platform,
 * or half a remembered title, has to get to the right song in one go. So these cover what the search
 * box actually narrows the list to, and — as importantly — what it does *not* drop.
 *
 * The songs are written to disk and read back through the real loader, so nothing here can pass
 * against a fixture the app would not itself produce. See `SongsTabTestSupport` for why this tab is
 * reachable in a test at all.
