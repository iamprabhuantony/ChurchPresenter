/**
 * Rearranging the song table's columns by dragging its headers — reordering by dragging a header
 * sideways, and resizing by dragging the divider between two of them.
 *
 * Both persist through `onSettingsChange`, and that is the point: an operator sets the table up once
 * to suit their screen and expects it back next Sunday. Neither is reachable from a menu, so
 * dragging is the only way either happens.
 *
 * `SongColumnsTest` covers `moveColumn` and `computeNewIdx` as arithmetic; this covers the gesture
 * that feeds them and the settings write that follows, which is where a drag can be wired to the
 * wrong column or drop its save.
 *
 * The header cells are addressed by their labels. The **resize divider is not addressable** — it is a
 * bare 6dp `Box` with no semantics — so it is reached positionally, just past the right edge of the
 * header it belongs to. That is stated rather than hidden: if the header layout changes, these two
 * resize tests are the ones to re-check.
 *
 * Only the columns shown by default — number, title, songbook — have a resize test. Tune, Plays,
 * Author and Composer lay out past the right edge of the test window, so their dividers cannot be
 * pressed: the header node exists, the drag lands outside the window and nothing moves. Their arms
 * of `setColWidth` are therefore uncovered.
 *
 * See `SongsTabTestSupport.kt` for the harness.
