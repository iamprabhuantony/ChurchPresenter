/**
 * Driving the song list from the arrow keys.
 *
 * This is how the tab is actually used mid-service — the operator's hand is on the arrow keys, not the
 * mouse — and none of it was tested. What the keys do depends on two things at once: whether the song
 * is being displayed one *line* at a time or a whole section at a time, and whether the tab is what is
 * currently live.
 *
 * The rule that matters is the asymmetry between them. While **not** presenting, left and right walk
 * between songs so the operator can look ahead without touching the screen. While presenting, they
 * must **not** — walking off the live song would swap what the congregation is reading — so in line
 * mode they step through lines and push each step out, and in section mode they do nothing at all.
 *
 * Up and down step through sections either way, falling through to the previous or next song only when
 * there are no more sections and nothing is live.
