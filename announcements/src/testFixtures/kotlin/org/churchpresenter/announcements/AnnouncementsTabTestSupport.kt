/**
 * Harness and fixtures shared by the `AnnouncementsTab` test classes.
 *
 * This tab owns its view model outright (`remember { AnnouncementsViewModel() }`), so unlike the
 * other tabs there is no instance to reach in from a test. That turns out to suit it: everything
 * the tab does is observable from outside anyway — what it draws, the `AnnouncementsSettings` it
 * hands back for persisting, and what it puts on the output ([FakeAnnouncementsOutput]) — and asserting through
 * those keeps the tests pinned to behaviour rather than to the view model's internals.
 *
 * The settings the tab reports are fed back into it, as the app does, so a control's effect is
 * visible on the next frame and the tests read the way the tab is actually used.
