/**
 * The layer map today's single live mode amounts to: one cue for any mode but [Presenting.NONE], on
 * the layer the mode's content belongs to, built from what the outputs draw rather than what the
 * operator chose -- and for Bible and songs, their background on the background layer.
 *
 * A mode always has its cue, even before its content arrives (no picture yet, no scene chosen):
 * the outputs drew that mode's presenter regardless, and a picture fading out still needs it.
 *
 * Steps 1 to 3 of the layer-model migration (`docs/LAYER_MODEL.md`): program is derived, and the
 * outputs draw from it. It goes once the content setters write cues themselves.
