/**
 * Where an announcement, a question and a caption land on the screen.
 *
 * The same nine-position picker appears in three settings tabs, and each of the three presenters
 * carries its own copy of the string → [Alignment] mapping. Three copies of a table is three
 * chances for one of them to disagree, and the disagreement is not visible to whoever edits it:
 * the setting says "Bottom Right", the announcement obeys, and the caption underneath it quietly
 * sits somewhere else — on the output screen only, which nobody is looking at while configuring.
 *
 * So this pins each table against the picker's own nine values, and the three against each other.
 * All three are private, so they are reached by reflection on their file classes.
