/**
 * Harness and node locators shared by the `ServerSettingsTab` test classes.
 *
 * Two things make this tab different from the other settings tabs, and both shape everything here.
 *
 * **It owns real collaborators.** `RemoteClientManager` reads and writes
 * `~/.churchpresenter/remote_clients.json` *in its field initialiser*, so every test gets its own
 * `user.home` ([withIsolatedHome]) and constructs the manager inside it — otherwise tests would read
 * the developer's real allow/block lists and leak state into each other. `CompanionServer` binds a
 * real socket.
 *
 * **Half the tab is gated on the server actually running.** The Restart button, the Server URL row,
 * the QR button and the lower-third trigger URLs only compose when `isRunning` is true, and that
 * flag is owned by the server rather than by the settings — no fixture can fake it. Starting one
 * costs ~600 ms and stopping it ~1 s, far past the per-test budget, so `ServerSettingsTabRunningTest`
 * starts **one** server for the whole class and every other class uses a stopped one. That is why
 * the running-state tests never click the enable switch or Restart: those would stop the shared
 * server out from under the rest of the class.
 *
 * Known gaps — what these tests do not reach, and why:
 *
 *  * **The QR dialog** is a `DialogWindow` — a real AWT window — which throws `HeadlessException`
 *    under the suite's headless JVM. The button that opens it is asserted; it is never clicked.
 *  * **The Copy buttons** put text on `java.awt.Toolkit`'s system clipboard. Reading it back would
 *    assert on the developer's clipboard, and writing to it from a test is a side effect on the
 *    machine, so the buttons' presence and enablement are asserted rather than their effect.
 *  * **The enable switch and Restart** genuinely start and stop a server. They are driven once each,
 *    in `ServerSettingsTabLifecycleTest`, against a server of their own — not the shared one.
 */

/**
 * Forces the two `user.home`-latching singletons to resolve against the **real** home, once, before
 * any swap below installs a temporary one.
 *
 * This is not defensive: the tab calls `companionServer.updateFileUploadEnabled(...)` from a
 * `LaunchedEffect` on every composition, and that logs — so without this the very first test here
 * would latch `InstanceLinkLogger`'s log directory to a temporary home, which is then deleted, and
 * every later test in the JVM that expects to find that log would fail. `InstanceLinkLoggerTest` is
 * exactly such a test, and it did.
 *
 * `CrashReporter` resolves its paths in field initialisers, so touching the object is enough.
 * `InstanceLinkLogger` resolves its directory in a `by lazy`, which class initialisation does *not*
 * run — only an actual `log` call does, which is why one is made here. It appends a single line to
 * the real log; `InstanceLinkLoggerTest` measures deltas and filters by event name, so a stray line
 * under an event no one queries is harmless.
