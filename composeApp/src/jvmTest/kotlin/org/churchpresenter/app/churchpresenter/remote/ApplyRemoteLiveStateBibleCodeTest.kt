/**
 * The follower's **reference-only** Bible branch — the one path [ApplyRemoteLiveStateTest] leaves
 * out, saying it "needs a real `Bible`, which `BibleViewModel`'s own suites already build". They
 * build one, but none of them drives this branch, so it has never been exercised by anything.
 *
 * It is the whole point of a second-campus link between congregations that do not share a language.
 * In [BibleSyncMode.FULL_REPLICA] the follower shows the primary's wording verbatim; in
 * [BibleSyncMode.REFERENCE_ONLY] it receives only the **canonical verse code** and resolves that
 * code in its own, independently configured Bible — so an English primary drives a Russian screen
 * in Russian, and the verse text on the wire is ignored.
 *
 * Two things make this worth its own suite rather than a happy-path check:
 *
 *  * **The follower's own numbering must win.** Translations disagree about where a verse lives
 *    (Synodal Psalm 135 vs KJV 136), which is exactly why the code exists. The fixture below gives
 *    the follower's Bible a *different* display numbering from the code, so a branch that echoed the
 *    incoming numbers instead of resolving them would fail here and pass against a same-numbering
 *    fixture.
 *  * **Every way it can fail is a quiet no-op**, not a crash and not stale content: no local Bible
 *    configured, and a code this translation has no verse at (a versification mismatch). Both still
 *    have to leave the follower switched into BIBLE mode.
