/**
 * Format placeholders in the English strings must be positional.
 *
 * Compose Multiplatform substitutes only the `%<n>$s` / `%<n>$d` form. A bare `%s` is passed
 * through untouched, so `stringResource(Res.string.x, arg)` silently renders the literal text
 * `%s` — it does not throw, and nothing fails until someone reads the screen.
 *
 * That is exactly what happened: three strings added with the shortcuts feature used bare `%s`,
 * and the Undo/Redo tooltips shipped reading `Undo (%s)`. This test is the cheap guard that would
 * have caught it, and it covers the other fifty-odd argument-taking strings too.
 *
 * Only the default English file is checked. Translations are managed separately and this suite must
 * not encourage editing them.
