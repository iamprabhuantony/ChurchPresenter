/**
 * The link to the Bible Lookup Engine, driven against a REAL WebSocket server.
 *
 * The client's contract with the engine is not just "receive JSON": it has to announce its tuning
 * the moment it connects, push every later tuning change, and — the part that matters mid-service —
 * climb back on its own when the engine restarts, without the operator touching anything. None of
 * that is observable without a server on the other end, so a throwaway Ktor server stands in for
 * the engine here, the same approach [org.churchpresenter.app.churchpresenter.server.CompanionServerTest]
 * takes.
 *
 * Message parsing is covered separately by [BibleEngineClientMessageTest].
