/**
 * Harness and fixtures shared by the `ScheduleTab` test classes.
 *
 * The tab is driven through a real [ScheduleViewModel] — the same one the app builds — so what is
 * exercised is the wiring between the two: which view-model call a button makes, and what the list
 * renders from the resulting state. The view model's own rules (undo history, move semantics,
 * remote following) are already covered by the `ScheduleViewModel*` suites, so nothing here
 * re-tests those; these tests assert the schedule the operator ends up with.
 *
 * `user.home` is isolated per test because the view model resolves its autosave path at
 * construction and `newSchedule()` deletes that file. [TestSingletons.latchToTestHome] pins the
 * JVM-wide loggers to the real test home first, so they do not latch onto a temp dir that is then
 * deleted.
