/**
 * Harness and fixtures shared by the `SongsTab` test classes.
 *
 * **Why this tab is testable at all.** `tabs/` sat at 0% because a tab needs a real view model, and
 * `SongsViewModel` used to load its songs asynchronously on a shared dispatcher — so a test either
 * raced it or polled a wall clock for it. Since `ioDispatcher` became injectable (issue #56), the
 * view model loads *synchronously* from a temp songbook folder, which makes `SongsTab` ordinary
 * Compose: build the model, compose the tab, assert on what is on screen.
 *
 * Nothing is stubbed. Songs are written to disk with the real [SongFileParser] and read back through
 * the real load path, so the fixtures cannot drift from the file format the app actually writes.
 * `SongsTab` needs no `PresenterManager` and no host window — only a view model, an `AppSettings`,
 * and the section-selected callback.
