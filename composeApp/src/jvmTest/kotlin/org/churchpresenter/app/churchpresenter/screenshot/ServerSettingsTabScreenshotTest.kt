/**
 * The Server tab of the settings dialog, in both themes.
 *
 * **Half the tab only exists while the server is actually listening.** The Restart button, the
 * Server URL row and its QR button, and every lower-third trigger URL are gated on
 * `CompanionServer.isRunning`, which belongs to the server rather than to the settings — no fixture
 * can fake it. So a real one is started, once for the whole class (a start costs ~600ms and a stop
 * ~1s; per image that would be the most expensive thing in this suite), on a **fixed port and with
 * a fixed host override**, because the URL it publishes is drawn into the images: left to itself it
 * would print this machine's LAN address and a port that changed per run.
 *
 * Nothing here clicks the enable switch or Restart — they would stop the shared server out from
 * under the other states, and `ServerSettingsTabLifecycleTest` already drives them for real.
 *
 * `RemoteClientManager` reads and writes `~/.churchpresenter/remote_clients.json` in its field
 * initialiser, so every render gets a `user.home` of its own through `withIsolatedHome` — otherwise
 * these images would show whichever phones and tablets the recording machine had paired with.
 *
 * The connection QR the tab's QR button opens is shot too, through its content composable: the
 * dialog itself is a `DialogWindow` — a real AWT window — which throws `HeadlessException` under
 * the suite's headless JVM.
