/**
 * Every dialog that declares a fixed size and holds no scroll container, checked against the size it
 * declares.
 *
 * These six are the ones with no recourse: `rememberDialogState(width = …, height = …)`, most of them
 * `resizable = false`, and no `verticalScroll`/`LazyColumn` anywhere in the body. Content that needs
 * more room than the declared height is simply cut off — there is no scrollbar, so nothing on screen
 * indicates anything is missing. Everything else in `dialogs/` either scrolls or is resizable, and
 * can recover.
 *
 * The width and height in each case are **read from the same constant the dialog opens at** — see
 * `DialogSizes.kt`. They were originally copied as literals, which left the suite measuring content
 * against a number that no longer had to be the window's: editing the dp literal downward broke
 * nothing, because the test went on asserting against the old figure. `MemoryMonitorWindow` proved
 * it — it could be returned to the 440dp that clipped its Force GC row with every test still green.
 * Sharing the constant closes that: shrinking a window now fails the same assertion that content
 * outgrowing it does.
 *
 * `AddLabelDialog` is the case that already happened once: its height comment records 400dp cutting
 * off the nested colour picker "with no visible scrollbar to hint more was there", found by hand and
 * fixed by hand-measuring to 640dp. This is that measurement, kept — and `AddLabelDialogHeightTest`
 * pins the 400dp version as still failing, so these assertions cannot quietly stop testing anything.
 *
 * See `ViewportAssertions` for why the content is measured unbounded rather than checked for
 * containment.
 *
 * The three bodies that draw nothing but fixed string resources — `AboutDialogContent`,
 * `KonamiEasterEggDialogContent`, `MemoryMonitorDialogContent` — have no parameter to pass a longer
 * string through, so their growth case is covered by scaling the font instead. `TEXT_GROWTH_SCALE`
 * explains why that is both the only available handle and a real scenario in its own right.
 *
 * `MemoryMonitorWindow` is the one this suite found already broken. It needed 414dp of a 460x440
 * window — 6% of slack — and lost the bottom 26dp under the same 30% growth every other dialog here
 * absorbs, so it opened clipped for anyone running OS font scaling above ~1.06x. It has since been
 * raised to 500dp and given a scroll container, and it is measured against 500dp below. It is the
 * only one of the six that now scrolls; it is kept in this suite anyway, because "opens showing all
 * of itself" is the property worth holding, and the scrollbar is the floor under that rather than a
 * substitute for it.
 *
 * `CustomizeThemeDialog` is here for the same reason: its controls scroll only as a fallback, and the
 * growth case is not hypothetical for it — its own Extra large text size is the same 1.3x.
