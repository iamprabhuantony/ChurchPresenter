/**
 * The OBS tab of the settings dialog, in both themes.
 *
 * **It is a gated form.** Until OBS is switched on the tab is one switch and nothing else; switching
 * it on unfolds a connection card and a card of twelve scene mappings — the two shapes are different
 * enough to be separate images.
 *
 * **The status line cannot be posed from a fixture.** It is owned by [OBSWebSocketManager] behind a
 * read-only `State`, so each of its four states is produced by driving the manager for real against
 * a stand-in OBS started here — a Ktor WebSocket server on an OS-assigned port that speaks enough of
 * the protocol to finish, stall, or refuse the handshake. That keeps the images honest and, more to
 * the point, keeps them deterministic: the error text drawn on screen is then the app's own message
 * about the handshake rather than the host OS's wording for a refused connection, which differs by
 * platform.
 *
 * Every wait here ends on the manager publishing the status being waited for; none ends on a timeout.
