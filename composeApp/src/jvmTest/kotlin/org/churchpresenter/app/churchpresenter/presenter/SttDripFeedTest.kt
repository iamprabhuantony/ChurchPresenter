/**
 * The character arithmetic behind the letter-by-letter caption reveal.
 *
 * What matters to the room: the reveal advances at the configured pace, never re-types words that
 * have already been read, and never falls so far behind live speech that the caption stops being
 * the sentence being spoken. Every rule here is one of those three, and every one is exercised
 * against the caption string the presenter actually draws — [captionText] is the same joining
 * `buildDisplayText` renders, so a cursor position always means the same thing on both sides.
