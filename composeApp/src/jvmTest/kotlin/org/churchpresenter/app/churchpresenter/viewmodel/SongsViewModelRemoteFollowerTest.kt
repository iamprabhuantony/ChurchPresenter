/**
 * Following an Instance Link primary: the library is mirrored from a catalog with no lyrics, and
 * each song's lyrics are fetched on demand the first time it is selected.
 *
 * This is exercised with plain fakes — a real [SongCatalogResponse] and a stand-in `fetchDetail`
 * lambda returning a constructed [SongDetailDto] — driving the real remote code path
 * (`setInstanceLinkSource` → `selectSong` → `fetchRemoteDetailIfNeeded` → `toRawLyrics`). The fetch
 * The fetch runs on the ViewModel's `Dispatchers.Main` scope, so every wait here ends on a positive
 * signal — the populated lyrics, or the fetch counter being bumped from inside the fetch itself.
 * The cases where nothing is launched at all assert straight away, because `selectSong` returns
 * before starting any coroutine on those paths.
