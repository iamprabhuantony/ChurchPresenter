/**
 * The cross-reference column beside the verse list.
 *
 * It holds two kinds of row in one list — what the passage points at (the bundled TSK data) and
 * what this operator usually shows next (their own go-lives) — and the interaction is the History
 * panel's: click to go there, double-click to put it on screen.
 *
 * The repository is a fixture rather than the real 3 MB dataset, so these assert on the panel
 * rather than on what TSK happens to say about Genesis 1. The fixture points Genesis 1:1 at John
 * 3:16 and Psalm 23:1, both of which the shared Bible fixture contains, so a click has somewhere
 * real to land.
 *
 * See `BibleTabTestSupport.kt` for the harness.
