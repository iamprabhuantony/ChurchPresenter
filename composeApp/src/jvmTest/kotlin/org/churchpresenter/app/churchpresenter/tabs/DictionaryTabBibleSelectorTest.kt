/**
 * The dictionary's Bible-translation selector — which translation the "In Scripture" verses are read
 * from, as opposed to the app's primary Bible.
 *
 * It is drawn only once interlinear data has loaded **and** at least one `.spb` has been found, so
 * every other suite here runs with it absent.
 *
 * **Both halves are reached through the real API rather than by writing the view model's state.**
 * `isInterlinearDataLoaded` is set by the pre-load the tab kicks off itself (the harness already
 * stubs `InterlinearRepository`, so it resolves immediately), and `availableDictBibles` by
 * `loadAvailableBibles` over a directory of real `.spb` files built with [SpbFixture] — which also
 * exercises the title being read out of the file, since that is the name the operator picks by.
 * Every one of these properties has a `private set`; widening four of them to make a test simpler
 * would have meant testing a state the app cannot actually reach.
 *
 * **The label is uppercased by `DropdownSelector`** (`label.uppercase()`), so it is matched as
 * `SELECT BIBLE TRANSLATION`. Matching the resource's own casing would find nothing, and every
 * absence assertion below would pass while asserting about a control that was never there.
 *
 * Not covered here, and stated so the next reader does not assume otherwise:
 *
 *  * **The spinner** shown while a chosen translation loads. `isDictBibleLoading` is only true
 *    between the click and the file being read, which for a fixture-sized `.spb` is too short to
 *    observe without racing it — and it cannot be set directly.
 *  * **The `isInterlinearDataLoaded` gate on its own.** The tests below pin the inner
 *    `availableDictBibles.isNotEmpty()` gate, but not the outer one: the pre-load resolves against
 *    the stubbed repository as soon as the harness has waited for the entries, so the state that
 *    would isolate it — translations found, interlinear data still loading — cannot be held open
 *    without racing that coroutine. Mutating the outer gate away therefore fails nothing here.
