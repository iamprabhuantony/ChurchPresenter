/**
 * The three pure functions behind the remote-request banner: how an incoming action is classified,
 * how the item it names is described to the operator, and how a projected announcement's own styling
 * is folded into settings.
 *
 * The banner is an approval prompt — the operator reads it and decides whether a phone or a linked
 * instance gets to change what the congregation sees. A label naming the wrong song, or an action
 * classified as the wrong type, means approving something other than what was asked for.
 *
 * These lived in `main.kt` until the extraction that added this file, where nothing could reach them:
 * excluded from the coverage gate as app-entry wiring *and* sitting at 0%.
