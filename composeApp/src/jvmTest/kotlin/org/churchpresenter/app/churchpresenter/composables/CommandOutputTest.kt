/**
 * [readCommandOutput], the one step the device and window listings cannot do without a real machine.
 *
 * It is tested against real child processes rather than a mock, because what is being asserted *is*
 * the process handling: that stderr arrives merged with stdout, that a non-zero exit is reported
 * rather than swallowed, and that a command which does not exist comes back as a value instead of
 * throwing — every caller relies on that last one, since half these tools are absent on any given
 * platform. The commands are one-liners for the host's own shell ([shellCommand]), so the whole
 * class costs a few milliseconds and runs the same on Windows as elsewhere.
 *
 * Not covered: the timeout actually *expiring*. The parameter is in whole seconds, so provoking it
 * would cost at least a second of wall clock for one branch — more than the entire rest of this
 * file. The success side of the same branch is covered, which is the one that runs in production
 * every time a camera answers.
