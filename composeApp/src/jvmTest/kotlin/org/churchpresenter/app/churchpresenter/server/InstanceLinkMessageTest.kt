/**
 * What a **follower** does with each message its primary sends over the link.
 *
 * This is the whole inbound contract for multi-room mirroring, and it is pure: a raw JSON string in,
 * a callback out. The socket that delivers those strings needs a live primary; the dispatch does not,
 * and it is where the behaviour lives.
 *
 * Two properties run through every case and both matter more than the happy path:
 *
 *  * **A malformed payload is dropped, not propagated.** These arrive from a primary that may be a
 *    different version, so an unknown type or a payload that will not decode has to leave the
 *    follower showing what it was showing. Firing a callback with junk would put junk on the wall of
 *    a room nobody is watching from.
 *  * **Every decoded message counts as liveness**, including ones this build cannot act on. The UI's
 *    "last update Xs ago" is what tells an operator the link is alive rather than frozen, so it must
 *    tick on anything that arrived intact.
