 * [MacMenuBarActivationFix] is a Compose + AWT startup side-effect (a delayed window activation),
 * so its body needs a real window scope and desktop and is out of reach for a unit test. The one
 * decision it makes — whether this is macOS at all — is pulled into [isMacOs] and pinned here, so a
 * platform-string change can't silently run (or skip) the fix on the wrong OS.
