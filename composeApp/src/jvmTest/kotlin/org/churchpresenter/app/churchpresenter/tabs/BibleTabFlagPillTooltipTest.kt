/**
 * What the training-flag pills say when they cannot be pressed.
 *
 * `FlagPillButton`'s own doc states the rule and the incident behind it: pressing one has no visible
 * effect (it appends a line to a training log), so a disabled pill drawn in the muted palette was
 * indistinguishable from a working one — "an operator logged the same flag seven times in under two
 * seconds trying to make it respond". `enabled = false` therefore keeps the muted look **and hands
 * the tooltip a different string, explaining why**. Nothing verified that the different string ever
 * reached the screen.
 *
 * Two of the three pills describe *what went live*, so they are disabled with an empty output. The
 * third reports that the engine found nothing and is deliberately always available — a distinction
 * worth pinning, because making all three consistent is the obvious tidy-up and would break it.
 *
 * **Not pinned, and worth stating:** that the missed-passage pill is *always enabled* while its two
 * neighbours are gated. Being enabled has no observable difference here — the pill carries no
 * `disabledTooltip`, so it falls back to its own hint either way, and its click only appends to a
 * training log written through `TrainingDataLogger`, which resolves its path once per JVM and so
 * cannot be redirected from this suite. Gating it in the source fails none of these tests; only the
 * two neighbours' disabled state is covered.
 *
 * **The tooltip body only composes on hover**, so each test hovers with `performMouseInput` and
 * asserts **differentially** — a count before against a count after. The enabled tooltip repeats the
 * pill's own hint text, which is already on screen, so `assertExists` would pass without any tooltip
 * being drawn at all.
