/**
 * Harness and fixtures shared by the `LowerThirdTab` test classes.
 *
 * The tab is a preset picker over a folder of Lottie files: it lists what is in the folder, previews
 * one, and hands the chosen animation to the output or the schedule. So the fixtures are real files
 * on disk — the tab reads and parses them itself, and a stub that never parses would exercise the
 * error path instead of the one under test.
 *
 * Nothing here drives the ATEM upload panel: it reaches a switcher over the network, and what can be
 * decided before that is already covered by `CompanionServerLowerThirdTest`.
