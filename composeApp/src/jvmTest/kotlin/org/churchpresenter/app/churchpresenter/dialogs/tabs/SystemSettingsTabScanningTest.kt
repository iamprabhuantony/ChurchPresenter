/**
 * The folder-scan progress row in the directory settings.
 *
 * Why this exists: both the Bible and Songs folder scans run on `Dispatchers.IO` and take seconds
 * against a network share, and until this row landed the UI rendered "No files detected" in red for
 * the whole wait. Someone who had just picked the correct folder was told it was empty.
 *
 * **Not covered:** that `SystemSettingsTab` actually shows this row *while* a scan is in flight.
 * The tab constructs its own `FileManager`, so a test cannot hold a scan open, and asserting on a
 * state that resolves in microseconds would mean racing it — the flake shape `AGENT.md` rules out.
 * Making it reachable needs a production seam (an injectable `FileManager`), which is a change to
 * flag rather than to smuggle into a UI fix. What is covered here is the row itself, and the
 * scanned-to-completion outcomes are covered by `SystemSettingsTabTest`.
