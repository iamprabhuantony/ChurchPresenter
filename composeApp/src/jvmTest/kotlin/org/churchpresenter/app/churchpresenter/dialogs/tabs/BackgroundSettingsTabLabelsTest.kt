/**
 * A complete inventory of what the tab puts on screen: every heading, caption, label, content
 * description and stored value it displays, with the exact number of times each appears.
 *
 * The behaviour tests drive the controls; this asserts the words around them are actually there. A
 * caption is as much a part of the tab as the control it names — a `stringResource` pointed at the
 * wrong key, or a row quietly dropped in a refactor, changes nothing a behaviour test would notice,
 * because those find their targets by position or by displayed value rather than by caption.
 *
 * The counts carry as much weight as the strings. "Color" appearing five times is what says all
 * four content surfaces start out with a look of their own and the open one offers the segment; and
 * "Default" appearing twice is the rail row and the editor heading, which is the pair a locator
 * has to tell apart. The list was generated from the rendered semantics tree.
