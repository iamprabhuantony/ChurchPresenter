/**
 * The title slide's own song number, which #609 separated from the lyric slides'.
 *
 * The ask was a number small in the top-left of every lyric slide and large at the bottom-left of the
 * title slide -- impossible while the two shared one profile. So the interesting assertions are about
 * *placement*, measured: every one of these passes against the old shared layout if you only check
 * that "42" is on screen somewhere.
 *
 * The subtle half is what leaves the flow. The number reaches the slide by two routes -- a line of its
 * own, and `TitleSlideLine.number` riding on the title's line when `titleSlideNumberBeforeTitle` is on
 * -- and a cornered number has to come out of both, or it is drawn twice.
