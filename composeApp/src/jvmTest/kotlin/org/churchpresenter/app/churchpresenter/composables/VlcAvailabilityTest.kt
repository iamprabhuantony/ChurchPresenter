/**
 * What the app concludes about VLC, and which of the three "no video" messages the operator gets.
 *
 * The distinction is the whole point: "VLC isn't installed" tells someone to go and install it,
 * which is actively wrong advice when VLC is sitting right there but built for the wrong CPU, or
 * installed but missing the Visual C++ runtime it needs. Those are different problems with different
 * fixes, and the only thing separating them is the text libvlc failed with.
 *
 * The public `isVlcArchMismatch`/`isVlcLoadFailed` getters read two globals that a test cannot drive:
 * `isVlcAvailable` caches the result of actually loading libvlc on whichever machine runs the suite,
 * so on a box with working VLC it can only ever answer one way and the interesting branches are
 * unreachable. The decisions are therefore taken over their two inputs directly, and the getters are
 * one call each onto them.
 *
 * Detection is likewise driven per-platform through an `osName` parameter rather than by faking the
 * system property, which skiko latches JVM-wide.
