/**
 * The Bible tab of the settings dialog, in both themes.
 *
 * The tab is a rail of stack-wide settings on the left and, on the right, a live preview over one
 * set of styling controls. That one set stands for four stored profiles — verse and reference,
 * full screen and lower third — chosen by the two segmented switches above it, so the axes worth
 * shooting are the translation count (reorder controls appear past two, the Add picker goes at six)
 * and each position of those switches.
 *
 * The preview renders `BiblePresenter` itself rather than reproducing its layout, so these images
 * also catch a presenter change that alters what the operator is shown.
 *
 * The font dropdowns are deliberately never opened: their list is whatever `GraphicsEnvironment`
 * reports, so an image of one would differ by the machine that recorded it.
