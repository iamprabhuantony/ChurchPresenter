/**
 * The stage monitor — the screen the worship leader and the speaker read from.
 *
 * It is a grid of zones rather than one surface: every kind of content is assigned to a corner (or
 * to the whole screen), and each zone carries its own font, colours and alignment. So the states
 * worth reviewing are *which zone a thing lands in* and *what a zone looks like*, not just what is
 * live — which is why the layout shots below matter as much as the content ones.
 *
 * One image per state, not a light/dark pair: this screen paints from `StageMonitorSettings`, not
 * from the operator's theme.
 *
 * **The clock is switched off in every shot.** Its zone draws the wall clock, so leaving it on would
 * rewrite every one of these images the moment the minute turned — the same rule the Announcements
 * timer modes and the canvas clock source are held to.
