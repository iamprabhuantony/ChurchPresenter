/**
 * What an approved remote "add this to the schedule" request actually adds.
 *
 * This dispatch was written out four times in `main.kt` — twice for a single item, twice inside the
 * batch loop — and the two batch copies had drifted: they were missing the dictionary, announcement
 * and website branches, so those types fell to `else -> Unit`. `RemoteItemDto.toScheduleItem`
 * produces all three and `POST /api/schedule/add-batch` answers `{"ok":true,"added":N}` counting
 * every item it parsed, so a batch containing one told the phone it had been added while nothing
 * reached the schedule. `a mixed batch adds every item` below is the pin for that.
 *
 * Driven with a [ScheduleActionsRecorder] — `ScheduleActions` is a data class of lambdas, so
 * recording what it was asked to add needs no mock and the assertions are the real argument lists.
 *
 * Lived in `main.kt` until the extraction that added this file, in the same way
 * [ExecuteProjectItemTest] did for the project path.
