/**
 * A [CommandRunner] that answers from a script instead of the machine, and records what it was asked.
 *
 * Every enumeration in `SourcePropertiesPanel` and `SceneSourceRenderer` takes its runner as a
 * parameter so this can stand in for `xprop`, `ffmpeg`, `osascript` and the rest. Recording the calls
 * matters as much as the answers: several of these paths are defined by *which* command they run
 * next — whether the v4l2-ctl fallback fires, whether the walk stops at the first matching window —
 * and that is only observable from the outside as the sequence of commands issued.
 *
 * [answer] receives the whole command line, so a test matches on however much of it it cares about.
 * Anything unmatched comes back as exit 0 with no output, which is what a tool that ran and found
 * nothing looks like.

     * The **name**, not the token: ffmpeg is resolved to a real path before it is run — the copy
     * bundled with the app, an operator's override, or one found on the machine — so the token is
     * whatever this particular machine happens to have. Which tool was consulted is the question
     * these tests are asking; where it lives is not.
     *
     * The executable **suffix** comes off for the same reason the directory does: the same tool is
     * `ffmpeg` on macOS and Linux and `ffmpeg.exe` on Windows, so leaving it on made every
     * assertion here platform-specific and failed seven of them on Windows. `DeviceEnumerationTest`
     * already normalised it this way in its own `isFfmpeg` helper; this is that rule, applied once.
