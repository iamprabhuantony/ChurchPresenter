/**
 * The first-run wizard's navigation: which step follows which, and what each one offers to press.
 *
 * This is the very first thing a new user sees, and it is the only place the app asks for a language
 * and a theme before anything else exists — so a wizard that cannot be advanced, cannot be skipped,
 * or drops its final button strands someone on their first launch.
 *
 * `SetupWizardDialog` opens a `Window`, which cannot be composed headless, so the window's body was
 * lifted into `SetupWizardContent` — an extraction, no logic moved or changed — and that is what
 * these drive. The `Window` call itself, the eight-step *content* copy, and the wizard's placement
 * on screen are what remain uncovered.
 *
 * The step body is an `AnimatedContent`, so during a transition both the outgoing and the incoming
 * step are briefly on screen. Every assertion here is therefore made after the transition has
 * settled, and reads the step counter — which is outside the animation and always singular — rather
 * than counting step content.
