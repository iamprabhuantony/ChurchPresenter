/**
 * The identity a song is filed under.

 * [SongItem.songId] is the key the statistics store counts against, the schedule matches on, and
 * Instance Link addresses a song by, so it has to stay stable across an edit to the song's own text
 * and stay distinct between songbooks. It is derived rather than stored, which is what makes it
 * worth pinning: nothing fails loudly if the derivation changes, but a year of play counts would
 * quietly split in two.
