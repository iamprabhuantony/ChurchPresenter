/**
 * A complete inventory of the text the tab renders, with the exact number of times each string
 * appears.
 *
 * The behaviour tests drive the controls; this asserts the words around them are there. On a tab
 * built from six copies of one editor the counts are the substance: "FONT TYPE" appearing six times
 * is what says all six editors rendered, and a caption pointed at the wrong `stringResource` would
 * change nothing a behaviour test notices, because those find their targets by value or by ordinal.
 *
 * The list was generated from the rendered semantics tree, so it is exhaustive by construction.
 * Counts are over *values* rather than nodes: `DropdownSettingsField` merges its caption and its
 * current value into one node, so a zone name is counted once for the editor title that carries it
 * and once for every routing dropdown currently set to it.
