     * `DictionaryTab` brings it back into view with `animateScrollToItem` — an animation, started
     * from a `LaunchedEffect`, that `waitForIdle` returns out of the middle of. The capture then
     * lands at whatever offset the scroll had reached, so a different set of rows (and a different
     * scrollbar thumb) is drawn on every run. It looks stable on a fast machine and is not: this is
     * the "row heights are not stable between runs" the screenshot notes recorded, and it is why
     * this picture kept turning up in the pipeline's diff for changes that never touched it.
     *
     * The settled position is its own signal — the selected row's top stops moving — so this ends
     * on that rather than on a pause, and fails loudly if the list never comes to rest.
