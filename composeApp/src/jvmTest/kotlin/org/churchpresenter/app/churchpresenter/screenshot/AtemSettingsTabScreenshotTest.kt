/**
 * The ATEM tab of the settings dialog, in both themes.
 *
 * **What the switcher reported on the last Test Connection is the axis.** Every number on this tab
 * is a slot or a keyer index, and until a switcher has answered, the tab has no idea how many of
 * either exist: the fields carry bare labels, the capacity and keyer lines say "unknown", and
 * nothing can be out of range. Once the counts are known — they are persisted in the settings, not
 * held in memory — every one of those labels grows a range, the reference lines fill in, and a
 * number past the end turns its field red. So the states below are driven by those persisted counts
 * rather than by a switcher.
 *
 * **The Test Connection button is never pressed.** It opens a socket to a real ATEM: with one
 * plugged in the images would carry that machine's switcher, and without one the button spends its
 * connect timeout and lands on an error whose wording comes from the host OS. The states behind it —
 * connecting, connected, and the error line — are the only part of this tab these images do not
 * reach.
