/**
 * Drawing a shape onto the canvas by dragging, which is how every shape in a scene is created.
 *
 * The gesture turns a drag in screen pixels into a `ShapeSource` in normalised 0..1 canvas
 * coordinates, and the arithmetic differs per tool: a rectangle or ellipse takes the drag's bounding
 * box, a line or arrow additionally stores its two endpoints *relative to* that box, and freehand
 * stores every sampled point the same way. A shape whose transform or points are wrong lands in the
 * wrong place on the audience screen, or collapses to nothing.
 *
 * Everything here is asserted as an invariant rather than an exact pixel: the drag positions are
 * fixed but the canvas measures to whatever the layout gives it, and the normalisation divides by
 * that. What is pinned is the shape's identity, the ordering and containment of its bounds, and the
 * relationships between its points — all of which hold at any canvas size.
 *
 * A backwards drag (right-to-left, bottom-to-top) is covered deliberately: the code takes `minOf`
 * and `abs` throughout precisely so a shape dragged in any direction still has a positive extent,
 * and that is easy to regress.
