/**
 * The draggable strip between a side panel and the content beside it.
 *
 * There are two of these — the schedule panel on the left and the preview on the right — and until
 * this suite neither had a test: both were inline in `MainDesktop`, which only runs under a real
 * display and is excluded from the coverage gate. They are also the app's most-used drag handles,
 * and the place a drag-handle regression has already happened: a `pointerInput` keyed on the width
 * the gesture itself rewrites is torn down and relaunched at the end of every drag, so **the first
 * drag works and the rest do not**. A single-drag test cannot see that, so the case below drags
 * three times and is the reason this suite exists.
 *
 * The gesture is asserted through the callbacks rather than a rendered width: the caller owns the
 * width (it clamps and persists it), so what this component is responsible for is reporting the
 * drag at all, once per gesture, and only while expanded.
