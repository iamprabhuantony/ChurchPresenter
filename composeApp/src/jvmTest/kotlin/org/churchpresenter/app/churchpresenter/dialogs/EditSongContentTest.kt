/**
 * The song editor's rules: what it puts in the fields when it opens, when it will let a song be
 * saved, and what it hands back when it is.
 *
 * A song saved wrong is wrong in the library from then on, so the assertions here are mostly about
 * the `SongItem` that comes out of Save rather than about the fields looking right. Three things the
 * editor *derives* rather than passes through get a test each: the digits-only song number, the
 * title auto-filled from the lyrics of a brand-new song, and the secondary lyrics discarded when
 * they are nothing but section headers.
 *
 * `EditSongDialog` opens a `DialogWindow`, which cannot be composed headless, so the window's body
 * was lifted into `EditSongContent` — an extraction, no logic moved or changed — and that is what
 * these drive. The `Window` call and its sizing are what remain uncovered.
 *
 * Fields carry their captions as separate nodes rather than in their own semantics, so they are
 * addressed by ordinal. `the editor lays its fields out in a known order` pins those ordinals, so a
 * reordering fails loudly there instead of quietly changing what every other test types into.
