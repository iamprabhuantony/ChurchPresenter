/**
 * A complete inventory of what the tab puts on screen: every heading, caption, button label and
 * stored value it displays, with the exact number of times each appears.
 *
 * The behaviour tests drive the controls; this asserts the words around them are actually there. A
 * caption is as much a part of the tab as the control it names — a `stringResource` pointed at the
 * wrong key, or a row quietly dropped in a refactor, changes nothing a behaviour test would notice,
 * because those find their targets by displayed value or by ordinal rather than by caption.
 *
 * The counts carry as much weight as the strings. "FONT SIZE" appearing four times is what says all
 * four sections that have one rendered it; "FONT TYPE" appearing twice is what says only Word and
 * Reference offer a family. Both lists were generated from the rendered semantics tree, so they are
 * exhaustive by construction rather than by memory.
