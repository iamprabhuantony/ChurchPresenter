/**
 * The languages the interface offers, checked against the translations that actually ship.
 *
 * [Language] is what fills the language picker, and the string resources live in `values-<code>`
 * folders that nothing in the code references by name — so the two halves can drift apart silently
 * in either direction. A language added to the enum without a folder puts an option in the picker
 * that falls back to English; a folder with no enum entry is translation work nobody can select.
 * Neither shows up as a compile error, and neither is obvious to anyone who does not read that
 * language.
 *
 * English is the exception on purpose: it lives in the default `values` folder, which is also the
 * fallback for every other language.
