/**
 * Driving the Bitfocus Companion lower-third sequence.
 *
 * One HTTP call fans out into a timed dance the app owns the timing for: key on → pre-roll →
 * lower third live (an [onShow] emission the UI layer collects) → hold → post-roll → key off →
 * clear (an [onClear] emission). This test exercises the app-side contract that survives without
 * any ATEM in the room — a lower third must still go live and still clear — so it configures a
 * blank ATEM host, which the sequencer treats as "no key control" and never opens a socket.
 *
 * All waits are on a positive signal (the request arriving on [onShow], the clear arriving on
 * [onClear], the observable `status`), never on the pre/post-roll delays: those are set to zero and
 * the sequence is run in "show" mode (`autoEnd = false`) so nothing hinges on wall-clock time. The
 * sequencer is a JVM singleton with its own scope, so each test stops it afterwards to return the
 * shared state to idle.
