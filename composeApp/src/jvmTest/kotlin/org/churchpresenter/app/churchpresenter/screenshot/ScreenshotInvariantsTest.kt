/**
 * The two rules that decide whether a screenshot is compared in CI at all.
 *
 * Both fail **silently**. `.github/workflows/screenshots.yml` records with `--tests
 * '*ScreenshotTest*'` and matches images between the two sides of the comparison by their path
 * relative to [SCREENSHOT_ROOT], so a class named something else is simply never rendered, and an
 * image written outside that root simply has no counterpart. Neither produces a failure, a warning,
 * or a missing-file error — the image just stops being looked at, and stays that way for as long as
 * nobody thinks to check. Each has already happened: a batch of 63 images was dead on arrival for
 * the naming rule, and four files plus [PresenterScreenshotTest] had their own path literal.
 *
 * So these are asserted here rather than left to review. Reading the sources is the only way: what
 * the record task picks up is decided by a class *name*, and where an image lands is decided by a
 * path *literal*, neither of which exists as a value at runtime.
 *
 * Sources resolve relative to the module directory, the same way [AppPreviewSupport]'s fixtures do.
