/**
 * When the live preview panel offers a transport for the loaded clip.
 *
 * The bug this pins: a finished clip is left **loaded**, rewound to 0 and not playing, and the old
 * rule was "anything live at all, plus a loaded clip". So playing a video to the end and then going
 * live with a song brought the seek bar back, showing 0:00 of a video that was over.
 *
 * The rule cannot simply be "media is live" either, which is the trap in the other direction: audio
 * goes on playing while the operator shows a song or a verse -- that is a feature, not an accident --
 * and its transport has to stay reachable.
