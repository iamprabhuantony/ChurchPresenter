/**
 * The recent-folders bar in the Pictures tab: which folders it offers and in what order.
 *
 * Same shape as [PresentationTabRecentFilesTest], and the same reasoning. [RecentPictureFolders]
 * renders the bar straight off two `mutableStateListOf`s, so seeding those drives it with no file
 * I/O and no `user.home` swap.
 *
 * `add`/`togglePin`/`clear` themselves — and the JSON they read and write — are covered separately
 * in [RecentPictureFoldersLogicTest], which repoints [RecentPictureFolders.file] and
 * [RecentPictureFolders.pinnedFile] at a temp dir rather than clicking through this bar; nothing here
 * clicks a chip, a star or the clear button.
 *
 * One difference from the presentation bar is worth pinning: `clear` here **keeps pinned folders**,
 * which is why the ordering tests below treat pinned and recent as overlapping sets rather than as
 * two disjoint lists.
