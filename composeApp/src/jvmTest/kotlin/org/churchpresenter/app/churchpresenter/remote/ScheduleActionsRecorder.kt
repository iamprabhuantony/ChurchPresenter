/**
 * Records what the schedule was asked to do, as a stand-in for the real actions.
 *
 * `ScheduleActions` is a data class of lambdas with no-op defaults, so the "fake" is a constructor
 * call — no mocking library, and every recorded string is the real argument list the production code
 * passed. Supplying only the lambdas a test cares about leaves the rest as no-ops.
 *
 * Supersedes the private `Recorder` in [ExecuteProjectItemTest], which predates this file and covers
 * fewer actions; that copy can be deleted once something needs to touch that suite anyway.
