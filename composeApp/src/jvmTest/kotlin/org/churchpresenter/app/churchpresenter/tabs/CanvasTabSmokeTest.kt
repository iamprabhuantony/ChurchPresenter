/**
 * That `CanvasTab` composes at all on a machine with no display.
 *
 * It did not until [assignedDisplayBounds][org.churchpresenter.app.churchpresenter.utils.assignedDisplayBounds]
 * existed: the tab asked `GraphicsEnvironment` for the assigned output's bounds twice during
 * composition — once for the scene list's per-row aspect-ratio badge and once for the mismatch
 * warning under the canvas — and `screenDevices` throws `HeadlessException` when there is no screen.
 * That single call made the whole tab unreachable from a test.
 *
 * This is deliberately only a smoke test. It pins the thing that was actually broken — the tab
 * renders headlessly, with an assignment carrying stored bounds that match no real screen, which is
 * the shape that used to reach the throwing branch. Driving the compositor's controls is separate
 * work; what matters here is that it is now possible.
