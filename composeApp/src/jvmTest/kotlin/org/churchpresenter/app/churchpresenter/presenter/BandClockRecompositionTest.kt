/**
 * Reading the band clock must not recompose anything.
 *
 * The clock moves on every animation frame. When [LocalLottieBandClock] carried the *value*, every
 * composable that read it — including `BiblePresenter`, 1,355 lines with no inner restart boundary —
 * re-ran for each tick, on every output at once. The band still animated, but it dropped frames, and
 * the crossfade looked steppy rather than smooth.
 *
 * The local carries the state holder instead, so a reader gets an object whose identity never
 * changes and takes the value at draw time. This pins that contract: the fix is invisible to every
 * behavioural test, and the obvious "simplification" of providing the value would undo it silently.
