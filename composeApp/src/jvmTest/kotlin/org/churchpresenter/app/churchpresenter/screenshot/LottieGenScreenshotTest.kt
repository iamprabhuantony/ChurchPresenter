 *
 * It draws its own chrome from `org.churchpresenter.lottiegen.ui.Tokens` rather than from Material, so **both halves of
 * each stacked image are load-bearing here**: the tool follows the host app's theme, and the light
 * half is the only thing that shows it still does. It is mounted with `embedded = true`, which is
 * how ChurchPresenter mounts it — standalone it owns the theme and is dark either way, so a
 * standalone capture would photograph the same pixels twice.
