/**
 * Harness and locators shared by the `SongSettingsTab` test classes.
 *
 * The tab keeps **one** set of styling controls and points them with two segmented switches — Full
 * Screen / Lower Third, and the five element tabs — so a test names the combination the operator
 * would pick rather than counting occurrences of a repeated control. That is what [pointAt] is for.
 *
 * Locators work off what the production tree already publishes: the text on the switches and
 * controls, `testTag`s on the two title-slide checkboxes, and content descriptions on the position
 * and vertical-alignment icons. Nothing here asks the tab to be changed for testability.
 *
 * Two production quirks shape them. `SlimSlider`'s track publishes no semantics at all, so a slider
 * can only be driven by injecting a click at a computed coordinate. And the horizontal-alignment
 * icons pass `contentDescription = null`, unlike their vertical-alignment and position siblings, so
 * they are found by position under their own caption.
 *
 * ## Coverage removed with the old tab, not replaced
 *
 * The suites this replaced held 178 tests against a tab of four scrolling columns that rendered the
 * same eight styled-text blocks over and over. Most of them located a control by its ordinal among
 * those repeats — `StyleGroup.LT_LOOK_AHEAD_NEXT`, "one colour field per styled text block" — and
 * there are no repeats left to count. They were deleted rather than repaired because they drive UI
 * that no longer exists.
 *
 * What is genuinely thinner as a result, and worth restoring:
 *
 *  * **The label inventory.** One test asserted every string the tab draws, and its exact count.
 *    Nothing here replaces it, so a stray or duplicated label is no longer caught.
 *  * **Recomposition.** The old suite checked the tab survived a recomposition that changed none of
 *    its inputs, and that a settings change re-rendered around the control that caused it.
 *  * **Per-block independence at the pixel level.** `SongSettingsTabRenderingTest` painted each
 *    block's buttons and asserted a change to one left the others alone. The lens tests
 *    ([SongElementStyleTest]) now assert that at the settings level, which is where the bug would
 *    be, but not that the *painting* follows.
