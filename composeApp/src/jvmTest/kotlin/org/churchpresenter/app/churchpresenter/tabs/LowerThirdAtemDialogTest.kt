/**
 * The ATEM upload dialog — where a lower third is sent into a switcher's media pool before it can be
 * keyed over the programme feed.
 *
 * **This is the part of the tab that was unreachable.** The dialog builds itself from a live query of
 * the switcher, and that query is UDP with a **5s socket timeout**: no fast connection-refused, so
 * every test that opened it used to cost five seconds whether or not hardware existed. That timeout,
 * not the missing hardware, is what capped this tab at ~42% and got it written off as blocked.
 *
 * With the query injected, all of it runs instantly and deterministically — including the states no
 * hardware could reliably reproduce on demand: an unreachable switcher, a pool whose slots do not
 * include the configured default, and a device reporting a different frame rate than the settings
 * assume.
 *
 * See `LowerThirdTabTestSupport.kt` for the harness.
