/**
 * The Songs tab of the settings dialog, in both themes.
 *
 * A rail of slide-wide settings on the left and, on the right, a live preview over one set of
 * styling controls. That one set stands for ten stored profiles — number, title, lyrics, look-ahead
 * and next-section, on each of the two outputs — chosen by the element tabs and the Full Screen /
 * Lower Third switch above it. Nothing is below the fold any more: the rail scrolls on its own and
 * the styling side always fits.
 *
 * The preview renders `SongPresenter` itself rather than reproducing its layout, so these images
 * also catch a presenter change that alters what the operator is shown.
 *
 * The axes worth shooting are each position of those two switches, the controls that appear only
 * for some elements (reference position, chord colour), and the rail rows that come and go.
