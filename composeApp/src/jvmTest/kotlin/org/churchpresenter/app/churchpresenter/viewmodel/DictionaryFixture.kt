/**
 * A miniature Strong's dictionary for [DictionaryViewModel] tests.
 *
 * The real dictionary is ~14k entries across four bundled 1–2 MB JSON files that
 * [DictionaryViewModel.load] pulls through `Res.readBytes`. [stubResources] replaces those reads
 * with the handful of entries below, so tests get a known, tiny corpus — searching a real file
 * would make every assertion depend on data nobody in the test can see, and re-parsing megabytes
 * per test would dominate the run.
 *
 * Entries are deliberately varied: Hebrew and Greek, distinct transliterations, pronunciations and
 * definitions, so a test can prove *which* field a query matched on.
