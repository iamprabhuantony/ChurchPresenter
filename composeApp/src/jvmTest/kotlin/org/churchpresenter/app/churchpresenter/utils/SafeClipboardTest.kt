/**
 * [SafeClipboard]'s one contract: the failure Compose's own paste path does not survive becomes an
 * answer instead of an exception, and nothing else changes.
 *
 * The reported crash was `TextFieldSelectionManager.paste` -> `AwtPlatformClipboard.getClipEntry`
 * -> `WClipboard.openClipboard0`, at **fatal** — an operator pressed Ctrl+V and the app died. The
 * delegate here throws exactly what Windows throws, so these exercise the real shape rather than a
 * simulated one, on every platform.
