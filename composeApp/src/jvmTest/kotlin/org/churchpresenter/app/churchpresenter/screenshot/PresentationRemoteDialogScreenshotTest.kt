/**
 * The Presentation Remote dialog — the QR code an operator hands a speaker so they can advance
 * slides from their own phone — in both themes.
 *
 * Shot through `PresentationRemoteDialogContent` rather than the `DialogWindow` that wraps it: a
 * dialog window is an OS window, which a headless test has no way to photograph. The content is what
 * the window contains, and it is `internal` for exactly this reason.
 *
 * The box is the dialog's own 400x720, so what is reviewed is the dialog at the size it really
 * opens at — including where its content overflows, which is what makes it grow itself in the app.
