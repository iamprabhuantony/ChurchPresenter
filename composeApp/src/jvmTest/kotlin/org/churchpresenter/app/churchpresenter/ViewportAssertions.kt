/**
 * Asserts that what a fixed-size surface draws actually fits in the height it declares.
 *
 * Six dialogs declare a hard `rememberDialogState(width = …, height = …)`, most of them
 * `resizable = false`, and hold no scroll container. Content that needs more room than that gets
 * none: it is cut off with no scrollbar, so nothing on screen indicates anything is missing. The
 * most likely way to outgrow the window is translation — English ships the shortest string of the
 * fourteen locales — but a longer song title or host name does it too.
 *
 * **This measures minimum intrinsic height, and it has to.** Two more obvious approaches both fail
 * silently, each verified against `AddLabelDialog` at the 400dp its own height comment records as
 * broken:
 *
 *  - *Compose into a box of the declared size and look for nodes lying outside it.* `Modifier.size`
 *    hands the content a `maxHeight`, and Compose honours it: children are measured against the
 *    space that is left rather than spilling past the edge, so every node reports a position inside
 *    the box while the text inside them is squeezed and clipped. Nothing is ever outside the box,
 *    which is precisely why this defect is invisible on screen too. Passes at 400dp.
 *  - *Compose at the real width with unbounded height and read where the content settles.* A child
 *    with `Modifier.weight(1f)` — which this editor's content column has — is dividing up leftover
 *    space, and there is no meaningful way to divide an infinite height, so it collapses. Reported
 *    210dp for content that needs 474dp, and passes at 400dp for that reason.
 *
 * `IntrinsicSize.Min` asks each child how much height it needs at this width and resolves weights
 * against the answer, which is the question actually being asked. The cost is that it requires the
 * content to support intrinsic measurement; a composable that does not will throw rather than
 * mislead, which is the right failure.

 * read the non-English locale files (`AGENT.md`: they are managed separately). Gating CI on their
 * contents would also mean a translator lengthening a sentence breaks the build, which is the wrong
 * place to catch it.
 *
 * Scaling the font instead grows the text without inventing any, and it is not merely a stand-in:
 * desktop OS font scaling is a real setting real users have on, so a dialog that cannot absorb 1.3x
 * is already broken for them regardless of language.
 *
 * The figure is the rule of thumb for translation expansion out of English — English is the most
 * compact of the fourteen locales shipped, and German and the Slavic languages commonly run ~30%
 * longer. It is an approximation of length growth by height growth, not a substitute for rendering
 * the real strings, and the dialogs that only get this treatment say so.

/**
 * Composes [content] into a surface of exactly [width] x [height], for the sideways check below.
 *
 * Deliberately a fixed box rather than the intrinsic measurement [Viewport] uses. Two reasons, and
 * the first alone is decisive:
 *
 *  - **Width overflow is visible in positions, where height overflow is not.** A `Column` given a
 *    `maxHeight` squeezes its children into it; a `Row` does no such thing — unweighted children
 *    keep the width they asked for and are simply placed past the edge. So the containment check
 *    that reads as vacuous for height is exactly right for width, and is what lateral clipping
 *    actually looks like.
 *  - `IntrinsicSize.Min` on width over a whole settings tab does not return in any practical time.
 *    Intrinsic measurement re-measures the subtree per query, and these tabs nest deeply enough for
 *    that to become unusable — a probe over twelve of them was killed after 17 minutes with nothing
 *    reported. Nothing in this file may use it for width.
