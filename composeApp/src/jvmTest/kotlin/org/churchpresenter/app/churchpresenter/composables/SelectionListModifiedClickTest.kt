/**
 * The right-click and plain-click paths of the reusable selection list.
 *
 * The list resolves every gesture itself inside a raw `pointerInput`, so which callback fires is its
 * decision rather than the caller's — and a right-click landing on the selection path would move the
 * operator's selection when they only meant to open a menu. Each callback is also checked as
 * *optional*, since the list is used both with and without them.
 *
 * **Two paths are deliberately not covered here.** The ctrl/cmd and shift branches read
 * `event.keyboardModifiers`, which the test API does not let a test set on an injected pointer event —
 * a "ctrl-click" test would really be a plain click asserting the wrong branch, which is worse than no
 * test. And the double-click branch compares two `System.currentTimeMillis()` readings against a
 * 300 ms window, so testing it would mean asserting on the clock. Both are covered indirectly where
 * the callers use them (`BibleTabBrowseTest` drives multi-verse selection through the Bible tab).
