/**
 * Reading a `.xwp` puzzle file and turning it into a grid.
 *
 * Puzzles are authored in a separate encoder app and shipped as XOR-scrambled Base64, so this
 * decoder is the only thing standing between a file and a blank screen — and it is deliberately
 * forgiving, skipping lines it cannot read rather than refusing the puzzle. That leniency is worth
 * pinning from both sides: a malformed clue must not take the rest of the puzzle with it, and a
 * file with nothing readable in it must come back as null rather than as an empty grid.
 *
 * The layout half matters because a puzzle can carry its own placement. When it does, the grid must
 * be exactly what the author saw; when it doesn't, the engine places the words itself by finding
 * shared letters, and its result still has to be a legal crossword.
