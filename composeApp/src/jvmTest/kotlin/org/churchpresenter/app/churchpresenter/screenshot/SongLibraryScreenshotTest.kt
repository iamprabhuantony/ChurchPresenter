/**
 * The Song Library Manager window, in every state it can be in, in both themes.
 *
 * Shot through `SongLibraryApp` itself — the same entry point the app's Help menu opens — against a
 * real temp folder of `.song` files. Nothing here reaches past that entry point: each state is
 * arrived at by clicking, exactly as a person would, so an image that is wrong means the window is
 * wrong rather than the fixture. The grid is laid out in the test window rather than the 1420x880
 * the real one opens at, so the columns past the right edge are scrolled to, as they are in a
 * narrow window.
 *
 * The grid, both menus and all four dialogs are covered. Two things deliberately are not:
 * - **The editor a row opens belongs to the host.** Inside the app that is its own Edit Song
 *   dialog, covered by `EditSongDialogScreenshotTest`; with no host editor the row shows no Edit
 *   button, so there is no state of this window to shoot.
 * - **A save in flight.** `SongLibraryState.isWriting` turns the footer buttons off while the
 *   folder is written; holding a write open long enough to photograph it would mean a dispatcher
 *   parked mid-save, and the state is one frame of the footer rather than a state of the window.
 *
 * The state *while the folder is being read* is covered, and is only reachable because
 * [SongLibraryApp] takes the dispatcher it reads on: [Gated] holds the load until the frame has
 * been taken, so the skeleton is captured deterministically rather than by racing a disk.
