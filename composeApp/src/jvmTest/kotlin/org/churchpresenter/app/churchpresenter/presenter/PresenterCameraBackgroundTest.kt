/**
 * A camera as it reaches a presenter: which one wins, and what carries the device along with it.
 *
 * [ResolvedBackground] is the one thing every presenter draws from, so a camera that survives the
 * ladder here is a camera that reaches a verse, a lyric and every output. What cannot be tested is
 * the picture itself — capture needs hardware and a display — so the split is deliberate: these
 * assert the decisions, and [ResolvedBackground.usesCamera] is the line the renderer keys on.
