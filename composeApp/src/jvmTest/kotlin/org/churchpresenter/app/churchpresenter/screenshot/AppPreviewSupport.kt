 * Where the fixture's media library lives — and, because the schedule row prints the path of every

 *
 * So it has to be three things at once: real (the path shown is the path used), writable without a
 * permission prompt, and free of the developer's own username. `/Users/Shared` is the macOS
 * directory that satisfies all three — it exists on every install, is world-writable, and names
 * nobody. Elsewhere, `/tmp` is the equivalent and is what CI uses.
 *
 * The two roots produce different text on screen, which is deliberate and harmless: CI only ever
 * compares its own renders against its own, and images are not committed, so a local recording never
 * enters the comparison.
 *
 * **The output snapshots resolve their files through this same value**, so they present the file the
 * tab preview actually put live. A second root spelled out in that test picks the *other* candidate
 * on any machine where both exist, and then quietly renders whatever a previous fixture left behind
 * there.

/**
 * The pixel density every app-preview render is captured at. `1f` unless overridden.
 *
 * The preview shots are the ones used for the website, where they want to be crisp on a retina
 * display — but this same harness is the CI visual-regression baseline that runs on **every** pull
 * request, and doubling the density quadruples the pixel work. `the announcements tab` already costs
 * ~3.9s against AGENT.md's ~1s bar, so making 2x the default would tax every push for a benefit only
 * a marketing export ever collects.
 *
 * So it is a knob rather than a new default. Recording high-DPI captures:
 *
 * ```
 * ./gradlew :composeApp:recordRoborazziJvm --tests '*AppPreview*' -PpreviewDensity=2
 * ```
 *
 * **The canvas has to grow with it.** `runSkikoComposeUiTest`'s `size` is in *pixels*, not dp, so
 * raising density alone does not render the same layout more finely — it scales the UI up inside an
 * unchanged canvas and crops it. Done that way the fourth thumbnail simply falls off the window and
 * the test fails looking for it. Multiplying the size by the density keeps the layout identical in
 * dp and renders it at more pixels, which is what "retina" means here.
 *
 * At 2 the whole-app shots come out 3200x2000 and the output shots 3840x2160. **Do not commit a
 * baseline recorded this way** — every image would differ from CI's and the next comparison would
 * report the lot as changed.
