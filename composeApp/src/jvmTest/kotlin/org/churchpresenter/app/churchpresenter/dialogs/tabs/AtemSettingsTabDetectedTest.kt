/**
 * The two read-only lines under the lower-third card: how much clip the switcher can hold, and what
 * M/E and keyer hardware it has.
 *
 * Both are written by a Test Connection and then persisted, so they are standing reference for the
 * operator rather than live status — which is what makes them testable from a fixture: posing the
 * detected counts is exactly the state a past connection would have left behind.
 *
 * The clip line has three shapes, and each is a decision worth pinning:
 *
 *  * **Unknown** — nothing detected, or a nonsensical frame rate to divide by.
 *  * **Equal banks** — the usual case, one capacity quoted once with the seconds it buys.
 *  * **Mixed banks** — an ATEM whose clip pool has been re-allocated unevenly, where quoting a single
 *    figure would be a lie about the smaller bank.
 *
 * The seconds figure is what makes the line worth having: frames mean nothing to whoever is deciding
 * whether an animation will fit, so the conversion by the detected fps is asserted, not just the
 * frame count.
