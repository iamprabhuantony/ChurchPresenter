/**
 * Choosing a song in the Songs tab, and what the tab hands the rest of the app when you do.
 *
 * Picking a row is the moment everything downstream depends on: the lyric pane fills, the schedule
 * gets the right song, the presenter is handed a section. A row that selects the *wrong* song is not
 * a cosmetic fault — it puts the wrong words on the screen. So these assert the identity of what
 * comes back, not merely that a callback fired.
 *
 * `SongsTab` reports the chosen section through `onSongItemSelected`; the harness captures it, which
 * is why the assertions can name a title and a verse line rather than a call count.
