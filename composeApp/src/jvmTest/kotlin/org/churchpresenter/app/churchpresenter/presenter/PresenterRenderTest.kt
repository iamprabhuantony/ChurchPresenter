/**
 * What the congregation actually reads off the screen.
 *
 * These render the two presenters that carry almost every service — a lyric slide and a verse
 * slide — in a real composition, and assert on the text that lands on it. Everything between the
 * setting and the pixel runs on the way: language selection, the title rule, the reference line.
 *
 * The failures this catches are the ones nothing reports. A song shown in the wrong language for
 * the room, a secondary translation that silently stops appearing, a verse rendered without its
 * reference so nobody can find it in their own Bible — each of those looks like a working app from
 * the operator's desk, because the operator is looking at a different screen.
 *
 * Both presenters lay out against the space they are handed, so each is given a screen-sized box.
 *
 * One thing is deliberately NOT asserted here: whether a title or number that IS composed is
 * actually visible. Both presenters keep a fully transparent copy of that row on every slide to
 * reserve its height, so the lyric does not jump as it comes and goes — and an alpha of zero is not
 * part of the semantics tree, so a test cannot tell the reserved copy from a shown one. Which
 * slides they appear on is covered directly instead, in [SongPresenterTitleRuleTest].
