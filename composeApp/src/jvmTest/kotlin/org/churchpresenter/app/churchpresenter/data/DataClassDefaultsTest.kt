/**
 * Default values for the small `data class`es in this package that every call site so far has
 * constructed with every field spelled out explicitly. The defaults are not decorative: they are
 * what a field decodes to when an older persisted file (a `.spb` cache, a statistics log) is
 * missing a field a newer build added — [StatisticsFileFormatTest] pins that at the file-format
 * level for the statistics types, and this pins the same contract for the classes themselves.
