/**
 * The quick backgrounds tray, as it sits under the live preview.
 *
 * Shot on its own rather than through the sidebar: it is one component with three states that have
 * nothing to do with the panels above it — open, shut, and with a pick standing. Shut is not just
 * the open one with the tiles hidden; it collapses to a row of mini swatches so a pick is still one
 * click away, which is the state a narrow sidebar spends most of its time in.
 *
 * Given a fixed width, because the tray lays its tiles out three to a row against whatever the
 * sidebar gives it, and a shot at the test window's full width would show a row it never draws.
