/**
 * The Crossword tab — the bundled puzzle game.
 *
 * The puzzles are real: two `.xwp` files ship with the app and the tab decodes them itself, so
 * these tests load what a user would actually see rather than a fixture that could drift from the
 * format the decoder expects. That also means the assertions stay away from any particular puzzle's
 * words — what is pinned is the shell around them: which level opens, that both directions of clues
 * are listed, and that checking an unfinished grid says so without advancing anyone.
 *
 * Progress saving is deliberately not asserted. The tab debounces it with a 500ms `delay` before
 * calling `onSettingsChange`, so a test proving a keystroke was persisted would be buying that
 * assertion with half a second of wall clock — a duration rather than work. The serialisation
 * either side of it (`serializeInput`/`deserializeInput`) is private to the file; if it ever needs
 * cover it should be widened to `internal` and tested directly rather than through a wait.
