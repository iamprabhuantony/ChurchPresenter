/**
 * Every theme has a name, and no two share one.
 *
 * This exists because of a failure that compiled cleanly: the top bar listed its ten themes as ten
 * hand-written rows, so the three themes added after it was written were simply absent from that
 * menu while appearing everywhere else. A `when` over the enum cannot do that — it fails to
 * compile — but nothing stopped a caller pairing it with a literal list, and nothing tested that
 * the names were distinct.
