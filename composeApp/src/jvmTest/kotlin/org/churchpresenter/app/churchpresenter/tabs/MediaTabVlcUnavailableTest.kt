/**
 * What the Media tab says when VLC cannot be used — which is the entire tab in that state, and the
 * state a CI runner is always in.
 *
 * There are three distinct reasons playback can be unavailable and each gets its own instruction,
 * because the fix differs: install it, install the *right architecture* of it, or repair a broken
 * install. Showing "please install VLC" to someone who has VLC installed but on the wrong architecture
 * sends them round a loop they cannot get out of — they already did the thing the message asks for.
 *
 * Reachable deterministically only because the tab takes the VLC state as parameters; the underlying
 * globals cache a process-wide answer off the host machine. See `MediaTabTestSupport.kt`.
