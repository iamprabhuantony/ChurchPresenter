/**
 * The settings tabs, checked for content that runs off the side.
 *
 * The dialog is resizable and every tab scrolls vertically, but **nothing scrolls it sideways** —
 * only `CompanionSatelliteSettingsTab` has a `horizontalScroll` of its own. A row too wide for the
 * dialog therefore has no recourse, in the same way the fixed-height dialogs in
 * `DialogViewportTest` have none downwards.
 *
 * Unlike vertical overflow, this one is visible in the layout: a `Column` given a `maxHeight`
 * squeezes its children to fit, but a `Row` does not shrink unweighted children — it places them
 * past the edge. So the containment check that is vacuous for height is the correct one here.
 *
 * **This currently finds nothing, and that is the result.** Every tab was measured at 400, 500, 600
 * and 700dp and none overflowed at any of them, so the concern that these tabs clip laterally when
 * the dialog is narrowed does not reproduce. The test is kept as the regression guard for that,
 * pinned at the narrowest width worth supporting rather than at the widths it was explored with.

     * dragging it narrower than this is past what any layout here promises.
