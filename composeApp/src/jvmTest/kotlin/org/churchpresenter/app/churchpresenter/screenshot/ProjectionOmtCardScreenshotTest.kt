 * The OMT outputs card, in each state a reviewer should see.

 * Shot on its own rather than through the Projection tab, for the reason the Camera Capture card is:
 * it sits below the NDI card on a scrolling page, well past where the tab's images are clipped.
 * Everything the card would read from the machine — the library, the receiver count, the network
 * name — is pinned.
