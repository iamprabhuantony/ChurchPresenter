/**
 * The report window's shell: the tab row over the three bodies, the quick-range presets, and what is
 * shown before anything has ever been recorded.
 *
 * `CCLIReportDialog` opens a `DialogWindow`, which cannot be composed headless, so the window's body
 * was lifted into `CCLIReportContent` — an extraction, no logic moved or changed — and that is what
 * these drive. `CCLIReportContentTest` covers the three report bodies underneath; this covers the
 * frame around them.
 *
 * `StatisticsManager` resolves `user.home` in its field initialisers and writes its two JSON files
 * there, so every test builds one inside an isolated home ([withStatsHome]) and seeds it through the
 * public recording API — the same path the app uses.
 *
 * The report loads its three result sets on a background dispatcher, so tests wait for the tab
 * counts to arrive rather than pausing: the count in the tab label is the positive signal that the
 * load finished.
 *
 * The export buttons open a native save dialog through `FileChooser.platformInstance`; the export
 * tests below replace it with a fake that "picks" a path without opening anything, the same pattern
 * `AboutContentTest` uses.
 *
 * Left uncovered: the `DialogWindow` call itself.
