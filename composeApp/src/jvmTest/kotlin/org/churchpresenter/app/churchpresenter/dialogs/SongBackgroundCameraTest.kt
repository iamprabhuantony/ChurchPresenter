/**
 * Picking a camera as a background, and the one property that has to hold across all three places
 * a camera can be picked.
 *
 * The capture behind a camera is shared and ref-counted on the device's identity alone, and a
 * device opens **once**: a second key for the same hardware is a second ffmpeg process that fails
 * `DEVICE_BUSY`, or two DeckLink handles fighting over one input. So a background and a Canvas
 * layer pointed at the same device must produce the same key — which is what these assert, against
 * the real `keyFor` rather than against a restatement of it.
