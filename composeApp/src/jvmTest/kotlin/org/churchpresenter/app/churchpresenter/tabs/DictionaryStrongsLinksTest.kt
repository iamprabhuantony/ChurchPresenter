/**
 * `buildStrongsAnnotatedString` — the pass that turns the `H1234`/`G5678` references inside a
 * Strong's definition into the links the operator clicks to follow a word.
 *
 * The definitions come from the dictionary data as plain prose with references embedded in it, and
 * this walks them with a regex, appending the text between matches by index. **The arithmetic is the
 * risk.** A wrong `lastEnd` does not throw and does not look wrong in a screenshot — it silently
 * duplicates or drops words in the middle of a definition somebody is reading aloud. So the first
 * thing asserted throughout is that the flattened text still equals the input exactly.
 *
 * Tested directly rather than through `DictionaryTab`: it is a pure function over a string, and
 * driving it through the composable would assert on a rendered tree instead of on the ranges it
 * actually produces.
