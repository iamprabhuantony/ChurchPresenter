/**
 * The Camera Capture card, in each of the three states it can report.
 *
 * Shot on its own rather than through the Projection tab because the tab's images are clipped well
 * above it — the card sits below the NDI one on a scrolling page, so a reviewer would never see it
 * there. Its states are also the whole point of it: the app ships an ffmpeg, so "which binary is
 * this using" is the question the card exists to answer, and each answer reads differently.
