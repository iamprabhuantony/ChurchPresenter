/**
 * `Modifier.elementOffset`, which is what places a positioned element in #613.
 *
 * The contract is the whole reason the range is unsigned: both axes are a percentage of the room the
 * element has to move through -- the frame less its own size -- so **0 is flush to the start, 50 is
 * dead centre and 100 is flush to the end**, and 100 lands flush whatever size the element turns out
 * to be. The request was for negative values to reach a position the old range could not; widening
 * the range reaches all of them without anyone having to work out which way -3 moves a label.
 *
 * The containment is arithmetic rather than a check somewhere, and that is what makes the "warn the
 * operator when it goes off screen" question moot: no configured value can put it off screen.
 *
 * Measured in a 200x100 frame holding a 40x20 child, so the room is 160x80 and the numbers below are
 * exact rather than approximate.
