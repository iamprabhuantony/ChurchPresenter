/**
 * Harness, locators and label constants shared by the `SourcePropertiesPanel` test classes.
 *
 * The panel is the canvas compositor's inspector: one public composable that renders a shared header
 * (name + transform) and then dispatches on the sealed [SceneSource] type to one of eleven private
 * per-type property blocks. Everything below drives it through that single public entry point — no
 * production parameter, test tag or widened member was added for these tests.
 *
 * **The feedback loop is the point.** Each control hands the caller a *copy* of the source with one
 * field replaced; [sourcePanel] feeds that copy straight back in, exactly as `CanvasTab` does. That
 * is what makes it possible to assert both halves of what was asked for here — the value the control
 * wrote into the model, and the text the panel then shows for it. A control wired to the wrong
 * `copy(...)` field fails the first; one that writes correctly but reads from somewhere else fails
 * the second.
 *
 * **Locating controls.** None of the panel's fields merge their caption into their own semantics —
 * `StyledTextField`, `DropdownSelector` and `ColorPickerField` each render the label as a separate
 * uppercased `Text` beside the control. So a field is addressed either by the value it is currently
 * displaying ([fieldShowing]) or by its ordinal among the panel's fields ([textFields]), and the
 * ordinals are pinned by a structure test in each class rather than assumed.
 *
 * Known gaps — what these tests do not reach, and why:
 *
 *  * **The two Browse buttons** (image and video) default to `FileChooser.platformInstance`, a real
 *    native dialog — but `SourcePropertiesPanel` takes a `fileChooser` parameter precisely so a test
 *    can swap that out, which [sourcePanel] does via its own `fileChooser` parameter. See
 *    `SourcePropertiesImageTest`/`SourcePropertiesVideoTest` for the Browse-button coverage that
 *    unlocks.
 *  * **Camera and window enumeration** shell out to `ffmpeg`, `system_profiler`, `xprop` and
 *    `osascript`. What they return is the machine's hardware, which no fixture can set, and on macOS
 *    the window listing can raise an accessibility prompt. The camera panel is handed [NO_CAMERAS]
 *    instead of asking; the window panel is driven under [withOsName] — see
 *    `SourcePropertiesCameraTest` and `SourcePropertiesScreenCaptureTest` for exactly what each
 *    reaches and what it leaves uncovered.
 *
 * Colour fields are driven end to end, through the real `ColorPickerDialog`, using the `recolor`
 * helpers already shared by the settings-tab tests.
