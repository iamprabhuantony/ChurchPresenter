/**
 * The Companion Satellite tab of the settings dialog, in both themes.
 *
 * A card per configured connection, each holding the connection details on the left and the three
 * placements — tab, left sidebar, right sidebar — on the right. What changes the shape of a card:
 *
 *  - **Whether a view model is supplied.** Without one the connect row does not exist at all; with
 *    one the card gains a Connect button and a status line. The tab takes it as an optional
 *    parameter, and both are real states of the app.
 *  - **Which placements are ticked.** Each ticked placement unfolds its own rows, columns, bitmap
 *    size and button-size cap, because each is a separate device registration with Companion.
 *  - **How many connections are configured.** The Remove button only appears past the first.
 *
 * **The status line is driven for real.** `CompanionSatelliteViewModel` publishes its states behind
 * a read-only map, so connecting, connected and the error line cannot be posed by a fixture — each
 * is produced against a stand-in Companion started here: a plain socket that speaks the few lines of
 * the satellite protocol needed to finish, stall, or refuse the device registration. The refusal is
 * what puts a *fixed* message on screen; a dead port would have shown the host OS's wording for a
 * refused connection instead, which is not the same sentence on every platform.
 *
 * **Every id in these images is a fixture.** `CompanionSatelliteSettings` generates its `id` and
 * `deviceId` with `UUID.randomUUID()`, and the device id is drawn in a text field — left to itself
 * it would be a different image on every recording.
