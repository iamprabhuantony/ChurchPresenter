/**
 * Animated-presentation step navigation on [PresenterManager].
 *
 * The step keys (advance/rewind) are identity- and visibility-guarded: they act only when the live
 * player is showing exactly the deck+slide the caller means AND that content is actually on an
 * output — otherwise the key must fall through to plain slide navigation instead of being silently
 * eaten by a player the operator can't see. [steppablePlayer] is the guard that decides this.
 *
 * A static PDF deck (never "animated") and a real player parked at its initial slide index (-1,
 * before any [PresentationPlayer.showSlide]) exercise the guard's branches without needing a real
 * rasterized frame; the player is closed in teardown.
