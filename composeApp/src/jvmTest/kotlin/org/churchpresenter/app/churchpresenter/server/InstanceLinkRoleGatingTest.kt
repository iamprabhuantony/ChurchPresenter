/**
 * The four decisions that separate the two Instance Link roles: whether this instance mirrors the
 * primary's output, sources content from it, replaces its backgrounds with it, and where it plays a
 * schedule item's media from.
 *
 * These used to be conditions inlined in `main.kt`'s root composable, unreachable from any test, and
 * they were wrong: everything that drives the *presenter* was gated on the connection alone, so a
 * Controller — which is defined as staying independent — mirrored the primary anyway. That is a
 * feedback loop rather than a cosmetic slip. A Controller going live sets its own presenter *and*
 * sends the command; the primary then broadcasts the resulting state back, and the Controller
 * overwrote what it had just put up with the primary's version of it. The primary's connect snapshot
 * replays its live state to every client, so it happened at connect time too, before the operator
 * touched anything.
 *
 * Hence the shape of this suite: every predicate is asserted over the **whole** status × role
 * product rather than at the one or two points a bug was found, because the property that matters is
 * the negative one — a Controller never follows, under any status.
