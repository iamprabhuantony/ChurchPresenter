/**
 * Drives the tab from its **input** rather than from its controls: the settings are replaced from
 * outside and the rendered cards must follow.
 *
 * Every box on a card keeps a `remember(...)`-keyed copy of its field, so a box showing what was
 * typed proves only that it echoed a keystroke. Here nothing is typed — which is what says those
 * keys re-seed when a settings import replaces the connection under them.
 *
 * It also exercises the three composables' recomposition paths: the tab, each `CompanionConnectionCard`
 * and each `CompanionPlacementBlock` are called again with parameters that may or may not have
 * changed, and the cards must neither lose their state nor pick up a neighbour's.
