/**
 * What a Browser Source output actually draws.
 *
 * This is the content of the `ImageComposeScene` inside [BrowserSourceVideoRenderer.start] — 209
 * lines that no test could reach while they were the lambda of a scene inside a coroutine, because
 * reaching them meant standing up the whole render loop. Extracting them into
 * [OffscreenOutputContent] makes them ordinary Compose, and this renders each of its three top-level
 * branches.
 *
 * These matter because a Browser Source is what a stream sees. The branches are mutually exclusive
 * and picked from state that changes live mid-service: hitting "identify" must cover the output with
 * its number, a stage-monitor assignment must draw the monitor rather than the congregation view,
 * and an ordinary assignment must draw the presenter for whatever is live. Getting the wrong one on
 * air is invisible to the operator, whose own screen looks right.
 *
 * The frame pump around this — `scene.render`, the dirty-rect diff, the PNG encode — stays in
 * [BrowserSourceVideoRenderer.start] and is still uncovered; its decisions are already tested
 * separately in [BrowserSourceVideoRendererTest] (`decideTick`, `computeDirtyRect`, `cropPixels`,
 * `encodeFrame`).
