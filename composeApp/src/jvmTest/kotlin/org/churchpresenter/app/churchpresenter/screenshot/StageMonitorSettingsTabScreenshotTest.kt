/**
 * The Stage Monitor tab of the settings dialog, in both themes.
 *
 * Two columns in **one** scroll container, so both move together and most of the tab is below the
 * fold: content routing and the Full Screen, Top-Left and Top-Right style blocks down the left, the
 * layout preview and the three bottom style blocks down the right. The scroll positions below walk
 * that the way an operator does.
 *
 * The axes worth an image of their own:
 *
 *  - **Where each of the fifteen content types is routed.** Every one carries a zone dropdown, and
 *    Bible, Songs and Next are offered one option fewer — they are meant to share the screen, so
 *    Full Screen is not on their list. The layout preview redraws from those choices.
 *  - **Six style blocks, one per drawable zone**, identical in shape but not in what they offer:
 *    only the two top zones can hold a song's chart, so only those ask for a chord color — and
 *    that renames the text color to "Lyrics Color", because once chords are on screen "Color" no
 *    longer says which.
 *  - **Four color pickers per block** — text, chord, background and shadow. Each is shot from a
 *    fixture color of its own, so the picker opens on a different hue in each image and it is
 *    visible which field it came from.
 *
 * The font dropdowns are never opened: their list is whatever `GraphicsEnvironment` reports on the
 * recording machine, so an image of one would belong to whoever recorded it.
