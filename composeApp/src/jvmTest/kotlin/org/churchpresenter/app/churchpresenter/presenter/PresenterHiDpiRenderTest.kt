/**
 * What the presenters draw on a HiDPI output.
 *
 * Every size a presenter draws is a `.dp` or a `.sp`, which the platform multiplies by the output's
 * density itself. Measuring the output in pixels to scale those counted the density twice, so a
 * Retina Mac or Windows at 150% drew everything `density` times too large -- and the auto-fitted
 * text, fitted correctly in the 1920x1080 reference space, then ran off the side of the screen.
 *
 * Songs and scripture scale every size they draw to the output, so the invariant there is the same
 * pixels twice: drawn onto a 1920x1080 *pixel* canvas as 1920x1080 dp at density 1 and as 960x540 dp
 * at density 2, the two must produce the same picture. Type a density makes bigger fails that
 * whether it overflows or not, which is what makes it catch the bug rather than the one line of the
 * one song that showed it.
 *
 * An announcement scales nothing -- its configured size is absolute `sp` and its inset is absolute
 * dp -- so the same pixels legitimately draw a different picture at a different density. What must
 * hold for it is the narrower claim the bug broke: the size auto-fit chose fits the slide it was
 * fitted to.
 *
 * The Q&A card takes the same fix and has no case here: its inset is absolute dp, which cancels the
 * doubling in the width its auto-fit measures, so the wrong units left the question the same size
 * on this canvas and no assertion over it separates the two. Only its height allowance was really
 * wrong, and a question tall enough to be bound by it wraps rather than growing.
