/**
 * Where every screenshot is written, relative to the module directory a Gradle test task runs in.
 *
 * **The images here are committed.** They are the artifact a human opens and approves before a UI
 * change is merged — a reviewer looks at them and asks for changes when a state is wrong, missing,
 * or badly framed. `.github/workflows/screenshots.yml` additionally renders *both* sides on one
 * runner and posts the visual difference as a PR comment; that comment is a convenience, not the
 * approval. **Re-record and include the images whenever a state you touched changed.**
 *
 * The cost is real and does not go away by being committed: Skia rasterizes text per platform, so
 * re-recording the same *unchanged* states on a different OS rewrites nearly every file — 15 of 16,
 * measured — and git keeps every version of a binary for ever. So **record on ONE platform per
 * branch**, and re-record only what actually changed; never re-record the whole suite out of habit.
 *
 * Two invariants govern the CI comparison, and both have already been broken once:
 *
 * - **A capture must be written under this root.** Images are matched between the two sides **by
 *   their path relative to it**, so one written elsewhere is not reported as *differing* — it has no
 *   counterpart and silently stops being compared. Go through [stackedThemes]/[captureComponent] and
 *   this is handled.
 * - **A class must be named `…ScreenshotTest`.** The workflow records with `--tests
 *   '*ScreenshotTest*'`; a class outside that pattern is never rendered in CI and its images are
 *   never compared.

/**
 * How long to let real work — decoding thumbnails, rasterising a deck — finish before failing.
 *
 * This is the *failure* path, not the success path: every one of these waits ends the moment its
 * condition holds, so a generous value costs a fast machine nothing. It exists only so a hang fails
 * the test instead of hanging the job.
 *
 * It is deliberately far larger than the work takes on a developer's machine. The record job runs
 * every `*ScreenshotTest*` class in one go on a two-core runner, so the same decode that finishes in
 * milliseconds locally competes with everything else for CPU. `PicturesTabScreenshotTest` had 5s and
 * failed on CI with *"Condition (no thumbnail still loading) still not satisfied after 5000 ms"* the
 * first time the job got big enough — while the identical wait elsewhere had been given 10s, which
 * is exactly the drift a shared constant prevents.
 *
 * **This is not the forbidden "widen the timeout to fix a flake".** These waits terminate on a
 * positive signal and the timeout never ends them on the happy path. The wait is also load-bearing
 * for correctness rather than just for passing: a thumbnail still showing its placeholder is a
 * *different image*, so cutting the wait short would produce a screenshot that differs from one run
 * to the next.
 *
 * **It must stay comfortably under a minute.** `runTest` — which `runComposeUiTest` builds on —
 * gives the whole test body 60s, and that is the outer bound no wait in here can exceed. Set to
 * 60s this constant could never spend its budget: a slow render hit the harness timeout first and
 * failed with `UncompletedCoroutinesError: After waiting for 1m, the test body did not run to
 * completion`, which names neither the wait nor the condition. 30s leaves room for the rest of the
 * test and still fails with the message that says what was being waited for.

/**
 * How much of an image may differ before `verifyRoborazziJvm` fails: **0.1%** of its pixels.
 *
 * Roborazzi's own default is **0** — one differing pixel fails. That is the right target and not yet
 * reachable here (see below), so this is deliberately a little above it rather than the order of
 * magnitude looser that a screenshot gate is usually given.
 *
 * **Why not 2.5%, measured on this set on 2026-08-08.** The smallest real changes cost far less than
 * a percent of the picture, so a threshold in the percents hides exactly what a reviewer wants
 * caught:
 *
 * | change | pixels differing |
 * |---|---|
 * | one switch flipped (`stageMonitorSettingsTab` chords on/off) | **0.19%** |
 * | a button and its status word (`obsSettingsTab` connected/error) | 0.66% |
 * | four switches (`dictionarySettingsTab` show/hide) | 0.76% |
 * | one sentence rewritten (`atemSettingsTab` capacity) | 6.2% |
 * | a row appearing and reflowing what is under it (`serverSettingsTab` API key) | 32.6% |
 *
 * At 2.5% the first three of those merge cleanly — a switch could be inverted, a status could go the
 * wrong color, and the gate would stay green.
 *
 * **What sets the floor is churn, not the threshold**, so the churn was fixed rather than the number
 * widened. Nine images used to move on every re-record; each had a cause, and none of them was Skia:
 *
 * - `colour_picker` (0.87%) — the picker's "Recent" row, JVM-wide state; see [PinnedRecentColors].
 * - `previewApp/about_*` (0.55%) — `BuildConfig.VERSION_DISPLAY` carries the git hash, so it changed
 *   on every commit. The dialog now takes the version as a parameter and the test pins it.
 * - `previewApp/settings_companion_satellite_*` (0.16%) — `CompanionSatelliteSettings` generates its
 *   device id with `UUID.randomUUID()` and the tab draws it. Pinned in the preview fixture.
 * - `previewApp/dictionary_light` (4.2%) — the interlinear index loads in the background and is
 *   queried once, when an entry is selected, so a selection made mid-load kept a partial count. The
 *   test now re-selects until the count is complete.
 * - `previewApp/canvas_*` (0.07%) — not churn at all: a stale image, never re-recorded after the
 *   canvas source list moved from emoji to real icons.
 *
 * With those gone the set is byte-stable across consecutive recordings, so **0.1% is slack for
 * anti-aliasing and nothing else — it sits under every real change measured above.** 0 is the
 * target; keep this only as long as something still jitters.
 *
 * The threshold is a *fraction of the whole image*, so it scales with the picture: on a stacked
 * 1024×1538 tab shot it is ~7,900 pixels, on a trimmed component shot a few hundred.
 *
 * Note the comparator underneath already ignores imperceptible color drift — Roborazzi's default
 * `SimpleImageComparator` counts a pixel as differing only past a color distance of 0.007, which is
 * about four levels of one 8-bit channel.
