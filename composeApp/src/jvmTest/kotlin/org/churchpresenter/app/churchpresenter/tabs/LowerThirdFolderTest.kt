/**
 * What the Lower Third tab makes of the folder it is pointed at.
 *
 * The preset list is rebuilt from disk on every change to the configured folder, through a chain of
 * guards — the path is non-empty, it exists, it is a directory, and each file in it is a `.json`
 * that actually parses as a Lottie. [LowerThirdTabTest] covers the two ordinary outcomes (a folder
 * with presets, and an empty one); this covers the ways the setting can be wrong, which is the
 * common case in the field, since the path is typed or picked once and then the folder gets moved,
 * renamed or deleted.
 *
 * All of them have to land on the same "no JSON files found" panel rather than an empty list that
 * looks like a working folder, or an exception on a tab the operator opens mid-service. That message
 * is distinct from the one for a folder that was never configured at all — a path that is set but
 * wrong is a different problem from a path that is missing, and the tab now says which.
