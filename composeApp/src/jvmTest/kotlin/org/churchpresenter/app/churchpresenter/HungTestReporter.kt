/**
 * Kills a fork that has stopped making progress, and says what it was doing when it stopped.
 *
 * The suite has hung outright three times (2026-07-30, then twice on 2026-08-21), each time ending
 * as a timeout rather than a failure. PR #361's per-class `START` line finally named the class --
 * `LowerThirdTabTest` -- but a class name is not a cause: the one stack captured shows the hang
 * inside `runComposeUiTest` teardown, blocked in `SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait` on the AWT event
 * queue, which means the thread that had to answer was not answering. **Which thread, and why, is
 * not in the class name.** A dump of every thread is, and that is what this writes.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a per-test timeout in the assertion sense: nothing here decides whether a
 * test passes, the threshold is far past anything this suite legitimately does (`AGENT.md` budgets
 * ~1s a test, and the slowest class is 37.1s for all of its tests together), and a test that trips
 * it was never going to finish. Halting rather than merely reporting is the point -- the fork stops
 * with a diagnosis instead of being killed at thirty minutes with none.
 *
 * ## What has been ruled out
 *
 * The hang has not been reproduced locally, on macOS, as of 2026-08-22. Recorded here so the next
 * attempt starts further along than this one did:
 *
 * - **`LowerThirdTabTest` alone does not do it.** Six consecutive runs of just that class under
 *   six-way CPU load, all green in ~82s. Note that passing `--tests` both stands the serial-class
 *   exclusion down *and* drops `jvmTest` to a single fork, so an isolated run is not the shape CI
 *   hangs in; do not read a green isolated run as evidence.
 * - **The full suite on four forks under load does not do it either** -- one clean run.
 * - **It is not the frozen test clock.** Twenty-four sites across the suite set
 *   `mainClock.autoAdvance = false` and none restore it, including the last test in
 *   `LowerThirdTabTest`, which leaves an animation live with the clock stopped. That looked like
 *   the answer and is not: a probe that tears down with (a) a ten-minute animation running and the
 *   clock frozen, (b) an unbounded `delay` loop with the clock frozen, and (c) the same loop with
 *   the clock auto-advancing, completes all three in under three seconds.
 *
 * ## The current lead (2026-08-27, occurrence four)
 *
 * That dump answered "what was the event queue busy with". It hung `LowerThirdFolderTest` -- a
 * different class from the three before, which is itself the point: the class is not the property
 * that matters. Two threads were `BLOCKED`, both inside `SnapshotStateObserver.drainChanges`:
 *
 * - `AWT-EventQueue-0`, in Compose Foundation's desktop scrollbar (`Scrollbar.skiko.kt` ->
 *   `getThumbPixelRange` -> `getAverageVisibleLineSize`) reading a `DerivedSnapshotState`, which
 *   calls `notifyObjectsInitialized` -> `advanceGlobalSnapshot` -> `drainChanges`.
 * - `DefaultDispatcher-worker-4`, in `LowerThirdOffscreenRenderer.withSession` calling
 *   `Snapshot.sendApplyNotifications()` per frame from `LottieRenderCache.renderToFile`. It is
 *   already inside an outer `drainChanges` and blocks entering a second.
 *
 * `advanceGlobalSnapshot` runs *every* registered apply observer, so a background off-screen scene's
 * snapshot advance reaches into the AWT scene's observer and back. `LottieRenderCache` is an
 * `object` holding its own `CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default)`, so a pre-render started by an
 * **earlier** test is still running during a later one -- which is why an isolated `--tests` run is
 * green (nothing started the pre-render) and why the hanging class keeps changing.
 *
 * ## Occurrence five (2026-08-29) proved it, and it is fixed
 *
 * [appendLockInfo] did what it was added for. Run 33269248282 halted `jvmTestSerial` after 159s in
 * `AppPreviewLowerThirdScreenshotTest` and printed `=== DEADLOCK CYCLE: 2 threads ===` **with lock
 * owners**, which is the ownership evidence `getAllStackTraces` could not give:
 *
 * - `DefaultDispatcher-worker-3` waiting on `SynchronizedObject@16e079a8` **held by**
 *   `AWT-EventQueue-0`, inside `sendApplyNotifications` at `LowerThirdOffscreenRenderer.kt:129`.
 * - `AWT-EventQueue-0` waiting on `SynchronizedObject@8cd911d` **held by**
 *   `DefaultDispatcher-worker-3`, inside the desktop scrollbar's `DerivedSnapshotState` read.
 *
 * So the inversion above was real, and the hypothesis is now a finding. The fix confines
 * `LowerThirdOffscreenRenderer`'s scene -- construction, every render, and close -- to the event
 * queue, leaving the pixel copy and file I/O on `Dispatchers.Default`. One thread in Compose's
 * snapshot machinery means no second lock order to invert against; there is no way to opt a scene
 * out of the global observer list, so single-threading is the available answer.
 * `LowerThirdOffscreenRendererConfinementTest` pins that property, and fails if any of it moves
 * back onto a worker.
 *
 * Note it was *not* enough to move the explicit `sendApplyNotifications` call the dump names:
 * `javap -c` on `BaseComposeScene` (ui-desktop 1.10.3) shows `render` entering the same fan-out
 * three more times per frame on its own, so hopping only that one line would have closed the door
 * the dump happened to record and left three open.
 *
 * `ComposeScenePump`, which drives Browser Source, NDI and OMT, is confined the same way since
 * (`ComposeScenePumpConfinementTest`), so every off-screen scene the app builds lives on the event
 * queue. A scene composed anywhere else still races them on Compose's global, unsynchronised caches:
 * the soak's own `OffscreenOutput` did, built on the test thread while a lower-third pre-render was
 * being built on the event queue, and hung in its constructor spinning in `ObjectIntMap.findKeyIndex`.
 * It is confined now too. Any new off-screen scene, in production or in a test, belongs there.
