/**
 * Uploading a lower third to the switcher from the tab itself — the button an operator presses,
 * rather than the REST route a Stream Deck hits.
 *
 * `CompanionServerAtemUploadTest` covers the server's path to the same switcher. This is a **second
 * implementation**: the tab builds its own `AtemClient`, connects, transfers and disconnects inline,
 * so nothing the server suite asserts speaks for it. That is the same trap #140 recorded for the two
 * presentation-upload routes.
 *
 * The three pieces that make it affordable are all established elsewhere and reused here: a
 * [FakeAtemSwitcher] on loopback instead of a real device, the render warmed once in `@BeforeClass`
 * so no test pays skiko's ~900 ms start-up, and the payload size read out of that same warmed cache
 * because the fake completes a transfer at a byte count it has to be told in advance.
 *
 * The fixture lottie is a pair of offset solid layers, not the shared empty-layer one: a uniform
 * frame run-length-encodes to about fifty bytes and rides in a single chunk, which would make "the
 * frame reached the switcher" true without a transfer having happened.
