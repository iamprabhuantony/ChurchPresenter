/**
 * The remote-permission dialog — what an operator is asked when a phone tries to do something — in
 * both themes.
 *
 * Every `RemoteEventType` gets its own image. They are not cosmetic variants of one another: each
 * carries its own wording, its own icon, and one of two accents (schedule edits read amber, the rest
 * read as the theme's primary), and the whole point of the dialog is that the operator can tell at a
 * glance what is being asked before they approve it.
 *
 * Presentation is resolved through the app's own `resolveRemoteEventPresentation` rather than
 * hand-passed, so an image cannot drift from what the dialog would really show for that type.
 *
 * Boxed at the dialog's real 500x290, or 330 tall when something is queued behind — the two heights
 * the app itself picks between.
