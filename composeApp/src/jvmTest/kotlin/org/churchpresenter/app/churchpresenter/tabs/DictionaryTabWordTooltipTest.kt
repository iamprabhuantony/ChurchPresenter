/**
 * The hover tooltip on an interlinear word chip — how an operator reads what a word in the verse
 * means without leaving the entry they are already on.
 *
 * **A `TooltipArea` body does compose under `runComposeUiTest`**, which is what makes this suite
 * possible: hovering the chip with `performMouseInput { moveTo(center) }` draws it. Roughly two
 * dozen files here have a `TooltipArea` and none of their bodies had ever been driven.
 * `CanvasTabTestSupport` had in fact recorded the behaviour from the other side — a tooltip
 * lingering after a click and swallowing the next one — which is the same fact, written down as an
 * obstacle.
 *
 * **Every assertion is differential — a count before the hover against a count after.** The tooltip
 * repeats the number, word and transliteration that the detail pane is *already* showing for the
 * selected entry, so `assertExists` on any of them passes just as well with no tooltip at all. Only
 * the count going up is evidence that this control drew anything.
