/**
 * The recent-files bar: which decks it offers and in what order.
 *
 * This document listed the bar as unreachable, "only through a `private object` that resolves JSON
 * paths from `user.home` at class-init". Half of that is wrong. [RecentPresentationFiles] is public,
 * and its `files` and `pinned` are `mutableStateListOf` — the bar renders straight off them, so
 * seeding those lists drives it with no file I/O, no `user.home` swap and no new test seam.
 *
 * What the entry got right is the persistence: the two JSON paths *are* resolved at class-init, so
 * whichever test touches the object first decides where the whole JVM writes. That is why nothing
 * here clicks a chip, a star or the clear button — `add`, `togglePin` and `clear` all save, and
 * `clear` against a real home would delete the developer's own recent-files list. Those handful of
 * lines stay uncovered on purpose; the ordering and rendering below are the part worth having.
 *
 * The ordering is the part that is easy to get wrong and annoying live: pinned decks come first, a
 * deck that is both pinned and recent must appear once rather than twice, and the deck currently
 * loaded is highlighted so an operator can see at a glance which of ten similar file names is up.
