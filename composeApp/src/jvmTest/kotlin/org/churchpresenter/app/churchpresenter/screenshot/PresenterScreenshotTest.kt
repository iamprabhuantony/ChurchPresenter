/**
 * Pictures of what the congregation sees.
 *
 * The rest of the suite asserts invariants — that a string is on screen, that a colour is what was
 * configured — because font metrics differ across the three platforms this app ships on and pixel
 * assertions would flake (see `AGENT.md`). These tests assert nothing at all. They render a surface
 * and hand the image to Roborazzi; the comparison happens in CI, between the images this branch
 * produces and the ones the base branch produces, both rendered on the same Linux runner. That
 * sidesteps the platform problem entirely: no committed image is ever used as the baseline, so a
 * stale one cannot fail a build on the machine reading it.
 *
 * The PNGs are committed, under `composeApp/screenshots/`, so a reviewer can approve what is on
 * screen rather than take the diff on trust. See `SCREENSHOT_ROOT`.
 *
 * Consequences worth knowing:
 * - Recording locally writes PNGs to `composeApp/screenshots/` and asserts nothing. It is still a
 *   smoke test: a presenter that throws while composing fails here. Re-record before pushing when a
 *   surface here changed, and record on one platform per branch — Skia rasterises text per platform,
 *   so recording on a second OS rewrites nearly every file whether anything changed or not.
 * - `captureRoboImage` is inert unless a Roborazzi task turned recording on, so an ordinary
 *   `./gradlew :composeApp:jvmTest` pays only the composition, not the file write.
 * - What a diff means is a judgement call, not a failure: a deliberate design change shows up here
 *   exactly like a regression does. The PR comment is there to be looked at, not to gate the merge.
 *
 * Add a case here when a surface is worth watching, not for every state — each one is an image a
 * human has to look at when it changes.
