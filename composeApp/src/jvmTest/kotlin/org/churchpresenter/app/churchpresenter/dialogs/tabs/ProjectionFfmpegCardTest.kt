 * Unlike the VLC and NDI cards beside it, this one usually has nothing to ask for — the app ships
 * its own ffmpeg — so what it must get right is *saying which binary is in use* and offering the
 * download only when the search came up empty. Rendering alone would satisfy JaCoCo; every control
 * here is clicked and the result asserted instead.
