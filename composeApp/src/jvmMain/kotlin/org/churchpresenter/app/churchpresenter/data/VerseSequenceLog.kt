 * What the operator tends to show *after* a given verse, learned from their own go-lives.
 *
 * The app already counts how often each verse is presented ([StatisticsManager]), but counts
 * cannot answer "what usually comes next" — that needs the order, which nothing kept. This does,
 * in `~/.churchpresenter/verse_sequences.json`, as counted transitions rather than an event log,
 * so the file stays small and answering a query is a map lookup.
 *
 * References are canonical (KJV numbering, books 1-66), not the display numbering of whichever
 * translation happened to be loaded, so a Synodal Psalm and a KJV Psalm land on the same key and
 * a church that switches modules keeps its history.
 *
 * @param file the store. Injected so tests get their own, rather than the singleton-with-a-mutable
 * -path shape used by the recent-files objects — a constructor parameter cannot leak between tests.
 * @param clock injected for the same reason: the session boundary below is a time rule, and a test
 * that had to wait out a real 90 minutes could not exist.
