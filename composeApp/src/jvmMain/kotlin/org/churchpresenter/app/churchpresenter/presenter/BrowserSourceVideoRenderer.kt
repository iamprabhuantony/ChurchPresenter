/**
 * Renders a Browser Source output's live content off-screen (no window, no JCEF — same
 * [ImageComposeScene] technique as [LowerThirdOffscreenRenderer]) and encodes changed frames
 * as PNG, so a remote OBS/vMix Browser Source gets a pixel-identical stream of the same
 * presenter composables used everywhere else in the app — no reimplementation drift.
 *
 * Supported content types: Bible, Songs/Lyrics, Announcements, Pictures, Presentation slides,
 * Lower Third (Lottie graphics), Canvas (scene compositor), Q&A, STT captions, Dictionary,
 * Media (muted — video frames come from the single master player via SharedVideoOutput;
 * audio stays on the main output; note real video never settles into an "unchanged" frame,
 * so MEDIA encodes continuously at the tick rate rather than only-on-change) and Website
 * (mirrors [PresenterManager.webSnapshot], which is only pushed while the Web tab or a real
 * output window hosts the live JCEF browser — a Browser Source alone cannot drive a site) —
 * plus Stage Monitor as a whole separate display-mode layout.
 *
 * The scene provides [LocalTransparentBlanking] = true, so "no background"/Transparent
 * renders genuinely transparent pixels (real alpha survives PNG encoding) for OBS keying,
 * instead of the black a projector window paints.
 *
 * Only encodes and emits a frame when the rendered pixels actually changed since the last
 * tick, so a static slide costs one encode, not continuous encoding — this is what keeps a
 * per-output stream far cheaper than NDI (which encodes continuously regardless of change
 * or of whether anyone is even watching). The "whether anyone is watching" half of that is
 * [shouldRenderTick]'s job: the loop parks entirely while the output is switched off or has
 * no subscriber, because until it did, the render and pixel readback were still paid in full
 * on every tick just to discover the frame was redundant. The one exception is a periodic full-frame
 * recapture (see [FULL_FRAME_RESEED_MS]) that fires on its own schedule regardless of
 * whether content changed, to bound how long a client can stay desynced from a dropped
 * dirty-rect delta (see [frames]'s KDoc for why that can happen).
