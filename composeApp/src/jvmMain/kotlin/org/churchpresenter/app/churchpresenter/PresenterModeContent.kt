/**
 * Draws whatever [mode] means for one window output: the layers it puts on air, through the
 * renderer every output shares ([OutputLayers]), with [profile] deciding visibility, layout and
 * language for that output.
 *
 * Shared by every output — the per-screen windows, the DeckLink fill and key surfaces and the
 * browser-source overlays — which each supply their own Window/Crossfade wrapper and differ only
 * in [outputRole] and whether backgrounds are drawn. [showBackgroundOverride] exists because the
 * key and DeckLink paths historically omitted `showBackground` and so took the presenters' `true`
 * default; passing `true` there keeps that exact behaviour rather than quietly changing what those
 * outputs render.
