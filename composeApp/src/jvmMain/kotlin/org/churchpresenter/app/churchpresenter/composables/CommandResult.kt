 * `SourcePropertiesPanel` and `SceneSourceRenderer`: each needs the machine's own `xprop`,
 * `wmctrl`, `osascript`, `system_profiler`, `powershell` or `ffmpeg`, and the hardware behind them.
 * Isolating it here leaves the sequence around it — which command is built, how the output is read,
 * what happens when it comes back empty or non-zero, which fallback runs next — exercised for real
 * against a stand-in runner, and collapses ten near-identical `ProcessBuilder` blocks into one.
 *
 * A command that cannot be started at all is reported as exit code -1 with empty output, which is
 * how every caller already treated the exception it used to throw. [timeoutSeconds] above zero
 * force-kills a command that outlives it; zero waits for it indefinitely.
