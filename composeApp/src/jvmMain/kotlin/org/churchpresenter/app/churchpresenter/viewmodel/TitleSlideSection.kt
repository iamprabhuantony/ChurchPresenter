 * Carries the song's number, title and credits as fields, which is what the presenter draws -- each
 * in its own element's profile, see `SongTitleSlideContent` -- and the same content as plain
 * `lines`, one per element the slide is set to show, for the readers that only ever see text: the
 * stage monitor and the companion app. Both come from [titleSlideLines], so they cannot disagree.
 * Its `songNumber` is the numeric part of the song number, or 0 when the number isn't numeric.
