/**
 * Displays a Lottie animation in the presenter window.
 *
 * When a pre-decoded [frame] is available (served by PresenterManager's LottieFrameStream
 * from the shared render cache), it is drawn directly — one bitmap decode per frame for all
 * windows together, off the UI thread. This eliminates per-frame rendering variance across
 * GPU vendors and drivers. Until then the live Compottie painter renders as a fallback.
 *
 * Animation progress is driven centrally by main.kt's playback clock so all presenter
 * displays stay in perfect sync.
