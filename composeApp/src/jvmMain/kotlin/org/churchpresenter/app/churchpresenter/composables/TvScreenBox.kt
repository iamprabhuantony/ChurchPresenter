 * something (a lower third, margins, etc.) is positioned, in place of a plain rectangle.
 *
 * [screenAspectRatio] is the shape of the **screen**, with the bezel and the stand excluded -- the
 * ratio lands on the screen node itself, so it is exact by construction and no caller has to
 * subtract the chrome. Pass the real output's ratio rather than a 16:9 guess; a mockup that is not
 * the shape of the screen it stands for misplaces everything drawn inside it.
 *
 * **With a ratio set, give this a width and no height.** The bezel and the outer column then
 * wrap their content vertically, so a fixed height either leaves dead space under the stand or
 * fights the ratio. Left null, the screen fills whatever height the caller imposes, as before.
 *
 * [modifier] always lands on the outermost node, so a RowScope/ColumnScope `weight` still works.
