/**
 * Puts one output's live content on the network as an NDI source.
 *
 * The same off-screen render every other virtual output in this app uses — [ComposeScenePump]
 * driving [OffscreenOutputContent], so an NDI receiver sees pixel-for-pixel what a Browser Source
 * and a projector window see, with no second implementation to drift.
 *
 * What differs from a Browser Source is what happens to the pixels afterwards. A Browser Source
 * encodes only what changed, so a static slide costs one encode; NDI sends every frame regardless,
 * because a receiver expects a continuous stream. So while there is a receiver this output has a
 * floor its neighbour does not — and while there is not, [shouldSend] parks it entirely, exactly as
 * the Browser Source parks on its subscriber count.
 *
 * In [NdiOutputMode.ALPHA] the content is drawn with transparent blanking, so the frame carries
 * genuine per-pixel alpha and OBS receives a keyed layer directly. In the fill modes it is drawn
 * with its configured background and flattened opaque, and [NdiOutputMode.FILL_AND_KEY] puts the
 * key on the network as a second source — see [NdiSender].
