/**
 * Where ffmpeg actually is, rather than where `PATH` says it is.
 *
 * **The app ships its own ffmpeg.** It is the one dependency of the three that may be redistributed
 * — this app is GPLv3 and ffmpeg is GPL, where NDI's licence forbids it and VLC is a separate
 * application — so cameras work on a machine where nothing has been installed. That is not a
 * convenience: nothing in the JVM ever touches AVFoundation, only the ffmpeg it spawns does, so on
 * a Mac with no ffmpeg no camera is ever opened, macOS is never asked for permission, and the app
 * never appears in System Settings → Privacy → Camera at all. Issue #464 is both halves of that.
 *
 * A discovered ffmpeg is still worth finding, because a bundled binary can be absent: an unpackaged
 * run before the download task has fetched one, or a Linux package that strips it. So the search
 * keeps the paths it always had:
 *
 * **A desktop app does not inherit the shell's `PATH`.** Launched from Finder, a macOS `.app` gets
 * launchd's default — `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` — which contains neither Homebrew prefix, so
 * `ProcessBuilder("ffmpeg", …)` fails to start with the binary sitting in `/opt/homebrew/bin`
 * where the operator installed it and where their terminal finds it every time. The same gap
 * exists on Linux for snap and flatpak, and on Windows for an unpacked build in `C:\ffmpeg`.
 *
 * The symptom is not "ffmpeg is missing". It is a camera that appears in the dropdown — device
 * names come from `system_profiler`, which is in `/usr/sbin` and always resolves — and then never
 * shows a picture, next to a hint telling the operator to install a tool they already installed.
 * That is issue #431.
 *
 * Resolution is cached rather than repeated: it costs a process launch, and every camera listing
 * would otherwise pay it. [recheck] is what clears that cache, and it exists for the settings row —
 * an operator who has just pointed [customPath] at another build gets an answer without restarting
 * the app. It is deliberately *not* a test seam: the decisions this object makes are the pure
 * [ffmpegSearchOrder], [bundledFfmpegPath] and [resolveFfmpegPath] beside it, and those are what
 * the tests drive.
