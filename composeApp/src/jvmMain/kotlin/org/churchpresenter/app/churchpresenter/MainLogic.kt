 * and is baked into the artifact, and — because `jvmArgs` is declared only on `JvmApplication` — a
 * call written inside a `macOS { }` / `windows { }` / `linux { }` block silently applies to every
 * platform instead of that one. A pin written here is read on the machine that actually runs the
 * app, so it is right whoever built it and wherever it ran.
 *
 * - **macOS** is pinned to Metal: left to choose, skiko falls back to OpenGL there and crashes on
 *   some machines.
 * - **Linux** is pinned to OpenGL, which is what guards it against a software fallback.
 * - **Windows** is deliberately **not** pinned. It used to be forced to OpenGL, which is the only
 *   reason a GPU driver fault landed in `WindowsOpenGLRedrawer.swapBuffers`; skiko's own Direct3D
 *   default is the better first rung. Note skiko's `fallbackRenderApiQueue` covers *context
 *   creation* only, so a fault during `swapBuffers` never triggers it — the default has to be right
