 * The editing card, in whatever height is left under the preview -- scrolling inside it.
 *
 * Without the scroll the card is laid out at its natural height in a column that has already run out
 * of room, so its last rows are clipped off the bottom of the pane with nothing to say they are
 * there. Which controls go depends on the element selected, since the panel is a different length
 * for each, so the same window loses the Reset button on one element and nothing on another.
