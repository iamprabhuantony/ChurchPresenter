/**
 * A [Clipboard] that answers instead of throwing when the OS clipboard cannot be taken.
 *
 * The system clipboard is a single OS-wide lock any running application can be holding. Windows
 * raises `IllegalStateException: cannot open system clipboard` from `WClipboard.openClipboard0`
 * when it cannot take that lock, and Compose's own paste path does nothing about it: a reported
 * crash went
 *
 *     TextFieldSelectionManager.paste -> AwtPlatformClipboard.getClipEntry -> WClipboard.openClipboard0
 *
 * and arrived in Sentry at **fatal** — an operator pressed Ctrl+V in a field and the app died, mid
 * session, on the Songs tab.
 *
 * The app's own copy buttons were guarded separately (`SystemClipboard`); this covers the half of
 * the problem that is not the app's code, by wrapping whatever [Clipboard] the platform installed
 * and swallowing exactly the failure that is not ours to prevent. Everything else delegates
 * untouched, so a working clipboard behaves precisely as it did.
 *
 * A copy or paste that could not happen is one the operator repeats. It is not worth ending what
 * they were doing.
