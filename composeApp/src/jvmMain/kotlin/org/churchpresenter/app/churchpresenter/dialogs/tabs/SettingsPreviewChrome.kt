/**
 * Measures [content] at [output]'s own pixel size and scales the drawn result into the box.
 *
 * **Why not simply hand the presenter the small box.** Both presenters derive their scale as
 * `min(maxWidth.toPx() / 1920, maxHeight.toPx() / 1080).coerceIn(0.5f, 3.0f)`, and a preview capped
 * at [SETTINGS_PREVIEW_MAX_HEIGHT] is never wider than about 460dp -- a true scale of 0.24 to 0.48,
 * *always* under that 0.5 floor. So the earlier version of this, which passed the small box through
 * at `Density(1f)`, got the clamped 0.5 every time: type, margins and the bottom inset all came out
 * between 4% and 108% too large for the box, lyrics overflowed the bottom, and the dashed guide --
 * drawn from the true, unclamped fractions -- marked a boundary the text no longer observed.
 *
 * Measuring at the output's own size instead makes the presenter's scale exactly 1.0, so the clamp
 * never engages and the margins, the auto-fit (which computes in the reference 1920x1080 space) and
 * the guide agree with the real screen by construction.
 *
 * The [layout] block reports the **scaled** size, so no output-sized node is left in the dialog's
 * layout tree -- which is what an earlier note here worried about, and is exactly how
 * `LivePreviewPanel.ScaledPresenterContent` has always done it. [LocalDensity] is pinned to 1 so a
 * measured pixel is a unit, which is what makes "the output's own pixel size" the size it is given.
