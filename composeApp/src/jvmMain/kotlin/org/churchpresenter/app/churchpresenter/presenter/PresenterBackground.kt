/*
 * What a presenter draws behind its text, and who gets to decide it.
 *
 * SongPresenter and BiblePresenter are the only two presenters that draw a background from
 * settings, and they resolved it with the same forty lines twice — which is why the per-song
 * background's gradient, dim and blur reached songs only. They are one function now, so a
 * background that can be drawn on a song can be drawn on a verse.
