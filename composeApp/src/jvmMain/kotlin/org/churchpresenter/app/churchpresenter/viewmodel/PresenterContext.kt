 * The parts are separate classes so that no one of them is the whole live state -- see
 * [PresenterManager] -- but a countdown still has to know whether an announcement is on screen, and
 * an animated slide whether it is visible, so these few things are held once, here, and handed to
 * each part that needs them.
