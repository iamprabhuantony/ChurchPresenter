/**
 * The two things a `Text` needs to carry a [TextBackdrop]: a modifier that paints it, and the
 * layout callback that tells the modifier where the lines ended up.
 *
 * Kept apart from [BackdropText] because the call sites that most want a backdrop are also the ones
 * that cannot use a wrapper — the presenters measure their own text to fit it, and already pass an
 * `onTextLayout` of their own. Those chain onto this; everything else uses [BackdropText].
 *
 * **The settings are state on one long-lived painter, not a new painter per setting.** A painter
 * draws from the last [TextLayoutResult] its `Text` handed it, and a `Text` only produces one when
 * something it actually measures changes — turning a backdrop on changes nothing it measures. So a
 * painter rebuilt on every settings change starts with no layout and never gets one: the backdrop
 * silently does not appear until the text itself happens to change. For the same reason the
 * `drawBehind` is always installed and the emptiness check happens inside it, rather than the
 * modifier being `Modifier` while the backdrop is off — a modifier that appears later would have
 * the same problem.

 * is the right call, and it carries a condition its own comment names: *only an ancestor that clips
 * would cut it off*. The presenters do clip, and their text fills the clipped box, so on anything
 * but centred text the plate had nowhere to go and was shaved off at the edge.
