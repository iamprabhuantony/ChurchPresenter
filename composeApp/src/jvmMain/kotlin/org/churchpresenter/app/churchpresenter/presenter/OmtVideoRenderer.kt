 * [NdiVideoRenderer]'s twin, over the same off-screen render — [ComposeScenePump] driving
 * [OffscreenOutputContent] — so an OMT receiver sees pixel for pixel what a projector, a Browser
 * Source and an NDI receiver see. It parks while nobody is connected for the reason that class
 * gives: announcing a source is the library's discovery threads' job, not the video stream's.
 *
 * In [OmtOutputMode.ALPHA] the content is drawn with transparent blanking and each frame is flagged
 * as carrying alpha, so OBS receives a keyed layer directly. In [OmtOutputMode.FILL] it is drawn
 * with its configured background and flattened opaque.
