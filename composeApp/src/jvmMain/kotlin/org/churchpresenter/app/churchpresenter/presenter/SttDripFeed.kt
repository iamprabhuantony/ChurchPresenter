 * delivers completed segments a few seconds apart; a per-segment cursor has to reset every time one
 * arrives, which snaps the previous segment to its full text and makes the configured speed
 * irrelevant whenever a segment cannot finish revealing before the next lands. One cursor over the
 * joined caption keeps the reveal continuous across segment boundaries.
