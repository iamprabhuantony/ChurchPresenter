/**
 * The looks this operator has actually used, newest first -- what the presets row offers.
 *
 * The row used to be four looks written into the source. Those are fine as a starting point and
 * wrong as the whole list: a church settles on one backdrop and uses it every week, and having to
 * rebuild it from a preset that is nearly right is the work the row exists to save. So the stored
 * looks come first and [TEXT_BACKDROP_PRESETS] fills whatever slots are left, dropping off the end
 * one at a time as the operator's own list grows past [MAX].
 *
 * Written to disk the way [RecentColors] is -- one small JSON file under the app's own directory,
 * failing silently, because losing a preset row is not worth an error dialog over.
 *
 * Deduplicated by content, not by when it was saved: pressing Save and then closing the dialog on
 * the same look is one entry, and re-picking a look already in the row moves it to the front rather
 * than storing it twice.
