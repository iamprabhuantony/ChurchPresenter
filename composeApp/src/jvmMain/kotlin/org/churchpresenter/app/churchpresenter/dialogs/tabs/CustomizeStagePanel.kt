/**
 * The 16:9 stage beside the Customize dialog's controls — what this output will actually draw.
 *
 * Every category previews through the **real presenter**, scaled down by [ScaledPresenterBox],
 * rather than through a picture of one: the Bible and Song panels here are the same
 * [BiblePreviewPanel] and [SongPreviewPanel] the global settings tabs use, so a style edited on one
 * screen's Customize dialog and the same style edited on the global tab are drawn by one piece of
 * code and cannot disagree.
 *
 * The dialog previously had no preview at all — an operator set a font size, closed the dialog and
 * went to look at the projector. The whole point of a per-screen override is that the screen is
 * different from the others, which is exactly when guessing is worst.
