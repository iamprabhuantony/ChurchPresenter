/**
 * The size each fixed-size dialog opens at, named once so the window and the test that measures it
 * cannot drift apart.
 *
 * `DialogViewportTest` asserts that a dialog's content fits the window it is given. While both sides
 * spelled the number out as a literal, that assertion held the *content* to a number and nothing
 * held the *window* to it: shrinking a dialog back to a size its content no longer fits broke no
 * test, which is the one regression the suite exists to catch. `MemoryMonitorWindow` demonstrated
 * this — it could be returned to the 440dp that clipped its Force GC row with the suite still green.
 *
 * These are the sizes of dialogs that cannot be resized, or whose height is hand-computed to fit
 * particular content. Sizes derived at runtime from the display — see `dialogSizeWithin` — do not
 * belong here; there is no fixed number to pin.
