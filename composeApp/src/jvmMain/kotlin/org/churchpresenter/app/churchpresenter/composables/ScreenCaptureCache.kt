 * One screen grab loop per distinct capture configuration, however many layers are drawing it.
 *
 * The same shape and the same reason as [SharedCameraFrameCache] and [NdiFrameCache], and it was
 * the last canvas source type without one. A screen-capture layer is composed once in the canvas
 * editor, once in each sidebar live preview, and once on each presenter output — and each of those
 * ran **its own** `Robot.createScreenCapture` loop at up to 30fps over the same pixels. Grabbing
 * the framebuffer is work the window server does, not the app, which is why an operator sees it as
 * the *compositor* pegged rather than ChurchPresenter: the reported machine had WindowServer at
 * 91-95% alongside the app's own 160%.
 *
 * Reference counted: the first layer to want a configuration starts the loop, the last one to let
 * go stops it.
 *
 * A class rather than the object it is reached through, so the whole of it is testable: [grab] is
 * the seam, and a test supplies one that returns a constructed image without ever touching
 * `java.awt.Robot` — which throws in the headless test JVM. That is a constructor parameter, not
 * the ad-hoc mutable `internal var` on a singleton that AGENT.md rules out.
