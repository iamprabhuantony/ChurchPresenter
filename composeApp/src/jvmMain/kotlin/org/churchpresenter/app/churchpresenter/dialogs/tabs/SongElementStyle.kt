 * below is about how the panel uses it rather than about the fields.
 *
 * [SongSettings] stores the primary's ten profiles as ten parallel families of flat fields, which is
 * right for a serialized settings file and wrong for a panel that edits whichever one the operator
 * has selected. This is the shape the panel wants: read one out with [elementStyle], hand the edited
 * copy back with [withElementStyle], and no control has to know which of the two hundred fields it
 * is actually writing.
 *
 * `position` and `chordColor` are stored only by the profiles that have somewhere to keep them --
 * see [SongStyleElement.hasPosition] and [SongStyleElement.hasChordColor]. The others read the
 * default and drop it on write, so a control for them is hidden rather than silently ineffective.
