/**
 * A backdrop for text drawn as several `Text`s that are one block to the eye — song lyrics, which
 * are laid out a line at a time so each can carry its own alignment, chords and look-ahead styling.
 *
 * The bands are per line either way. A border *on its own* is not: a box drawn per `Text` would put
 * one around every lyric line rather than one around the verse, so it is painted by the container,
 * around the union of what its lines actually drew, while each line reports where it ended up.
 *
 * With a fill under it the border stops being a box of its own and becomes the edge of the plate —
 * one shape per line, drawn by [drawTextBackdrop] like any other text. There is no union to take
 * then, and no block box: a square box around the verse with the fill hugging each line inside it
 * is the look this exists to avoid.
 *
 * A line reports twice, because neither answer alone locates it: [onTextLayout] gives the text's
 * shape within its own `Text` (a centred line does not start at that composable's left edge), and
 * the modifier from [lineModifier] gives where that `Text` sits inside the container.
