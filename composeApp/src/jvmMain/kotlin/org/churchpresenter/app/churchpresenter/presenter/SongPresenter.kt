 * The camera arm asks [cameraResolves] against the catalog's **last known** device list rather than
 * enumerating: this runs inside a `remember` on the composition thread of every presenter output,
 * and enumerating shells out to ffmpeg. Before anything has enumerated the answer is yes — see
 * [cameraResolves] for why accepting is the safe direction there.
 *
 * [knownCameras] defaults to that catalog and is passed explicitly only by tests. It is a parameter
 * rather than a read of the singleton because the catalog is process-global and a *composition*
 * fills it: opening a camera property panel enumerates, so a suite that renders one leaves every
 * later test in that fork looking at a populated catalog. Taking it as an argument is what makes
 * this decision testable without either faking a singleton or depending on what ran first.
