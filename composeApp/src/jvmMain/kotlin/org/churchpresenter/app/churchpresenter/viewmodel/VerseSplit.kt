/**
 * Showing a long verse as two halves instead of one shrunken block.
 *
 * `BiblePresenter` never cuts scripture off -- it shrinks until the whole of it fits (issue #97) --
 * so the longest verses in the Bible arrive on screen unreadably small, which is worst over a busy
 * background image. With `BibleSettings.splitLongVerses` on, a verse past
 * `BibleSettings.longVerseWordCount` words is shown as two pages instead, and the existing
 * next/previous-verse keys step through them before moving on to the next verse.
 *
 * The break is taken at the word boundary nearest the middle **by character count**, not by word
 * count: halves of equal word count are not halves of equal length, and the point of the setting is
 * that neither page is the one that still has to shrink.
 *
 * Which page is showing is tied to one publication of the selection -- see [currentVersePage] --
 * so anything that selects something else starts from a first half on its own.
