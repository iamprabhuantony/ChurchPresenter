 * A small swatch of what [backdrop] would draw — the fill behind a letter, the box around it.
 *
 * The button in the toolbar and every choice in its dialog are drawn with this, so the control
 * reports the look rather than naming it: which colour, how transparent, how round, and whether
 * there is a box at all are all visible without opening anything.
 *
 * [emptyOutline] and [emptyInk] are what it falls back to when the backdrop draws nothing of its
 * own — the surrounding button's own colours, so an off chip reads as an empty slot rather than as
 * a black one.
 *
 * Passing a null [label] draws a bar in place of the letter, which is what the four mode choices
 * use: at 26x15 a glyph is smaller than the difference between the modes, and the bar reads as
 * "text" at any size.
