/**
 * Renders a composable off-screen at a fixed cadence and hands each frame's pixels to a callback.
 *
 * This is the half of an off-screen output that has nothing to do with what the output *is*: build
 * an [ImageComposeScene], advance a virtual animation clock in step with real sampling time, flush
 * pending snapshot writes, render, read the pixels into a buffer that is reused rather than
 * reallocated, park when there is no reason to render, and close the scene on the way out. What is
 * done with those pixels — encoded as a dirty-rect delta, converted to BGRA and sent on the wire —
 * is [onFrame]'s business and differs per output.
 *
 * It was extracted from [BrowserSourceVideoRenderer], which had it inline, because [NdiVideoRenderer]
 * needs exactly the same loop with a different [onFrame]. Copy-pasting it would have made a fourth
 * independent implementation of "render Compose off-screen and push the pixels somewhere" in this
 * package.
 *
 * [DeckLinkComposeOutput] deliberately stays outside this: it renders through an off-screen `JFrame`
 * plus a `SkiaLayer` rather than an [ImageComposeScene], which is how it dodges a
 * `GraphicsLayer.toImageBitmap()` race, and that shape should not be propagated.
 *
 * The scene is built once per [start] and closed when the job ends, so the composition — and every
 * `remember` in it — survives across frames. Restarting the pump is what discards it, which is why
 * callers `remember` an instance keyed on the dimensions and fps that would invalidate it.
 *
 * **Everything that touches the scene runs on the event queue** — building it, rendering it,
 * closing it — and only the pixels come back to the worker. That is not a style choice: `render`
 * advances the global snapshot, `advanceGlobalSnapshot` runs *every* registered apply observer,
 * this scene's and the on-screen AWT scene's alike, and two threads doing that at once take those
 * two observers' locks in opposite orders. It was a real deadlock, proved with lock ownership on
 * 2026-08-29 (CI run 33269248282): `AWT-EventQueue-0` inside a desktop scrollbar's derived state
 * against a worker inside `sendApplyNotifications`, each holding the lock the other wanted.
 * `HungTestReporter` records the owners; `LowerThirdOffscreenRenderer` explains the cycle at its
 * own `withSession` and was confined first. Confining the Compose half to one thread removes the
 * second lock order, and there is no way to opt a scene out of the global observer list.
 *
 * This one was left exposed longer than that one because it drives a *live* feed, so the cost lands
 * during a service rather than on a bounded pre-render. That cost is now measured rather than
 * guessed at — see the numbers on issue #498 — and `readInto`/`onFrame`, the expensive half, still
 * run off the event queue.
