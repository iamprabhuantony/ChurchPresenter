/**
 * The app's single NDI runtime: the senders opened over it, and the receivers taking sources back
 * off the network into the Canvas.
 *
 * A process-level object for the same reason
 * [org.churchpresenter.app.churchpresenter.composables.DeckLinkManager] is one: the runtime is a
 * global in the native library, it is brought up once, and both the render wiring in `main.kt` and
 * the settings card that reports on it need to see the same instance without one being threaded
 * through the other.
 *
 * **It holds no logic.** Everything it appears to do is [NdiOutputRegistry]'s, which is an ordinary
 * class a test can build over a fake runtime — this is one instance of it, plus the shutdown hook,
 * which is the only part that genuinely has to be global.
