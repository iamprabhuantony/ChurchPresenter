/**
 * [SystemClipboard]'s one contract: neither call throws, whatever the OS clipboard is doing.
 *
 * The clipboard is an OS-wide lock any application can be holding, and Windows raises
 * `IllegalStateException: cannot open system clipboard` when it cannot be taken. Every one of the
 * app's copy buttons used to call straight into AWT, so that exception would have come out of a
 * button click on the event thread. The suite runs headless, where the clipboard is unavailable for
 * a different reason but through the same call — so these exercise the real failure path rather
 * than a simulated one.
