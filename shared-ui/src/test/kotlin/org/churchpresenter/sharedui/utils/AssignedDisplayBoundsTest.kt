/**
 * Which display an output assignment resolves to, and what happens when there is no display at all.
 *
 * The precedence matters in a real building: an operator sets the projector up once, and the stored
 * bounds have to keep winning over the stored index, because plugging in or unplugging any other
 * screen renumbers the indices while the projector stays where it is on the desktop. Getting that
 * backwards would silently move the audience output to the wrong screen after a cable change.
 *
 * The headless case is not hypothetical either — it is what lets `CanvasTab` be composed in a test
 * at all. The tab compares its scene's aspect ratio against the assigned display's, and used to ask
 * `GraphicsEnvironment` for that directly, which throws on a machine with no screen.
 *
 * Real `GraphicsDevice`s cannot be constructed and the test JVM is headless, so the topology is
 * faked with MockK, as in [PresenterScreenBoundsTest] and `FindScreenIndexTest`.
