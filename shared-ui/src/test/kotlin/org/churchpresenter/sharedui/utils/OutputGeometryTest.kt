/**
 * How big an output is, and therefore what shape a preview of it must be.
 *
 * The point of these: every preview in the app used to derive its shape from the first non-primary
 * physical monitor, whichever output it was actually previewing. These pin the replacement --
 * that the answer comes from the output itself, and that the three kinds read the three different
 * fields they actually store their size in.
