/**
 * The shutdown-hook guard.
 *
 * A hook that throws reaches the default uncaught handler, which is the crash reporter — so a
 * clean exit gets filed as a fatal crash. The hook itself cannot be run here without ending the
 * JVM, so what is tested is the body wrapper: it must run the work, and it must not let anything
 * out. `Thread.getUncaughtExceptionHandler` is what would have seen the escape, so the test drives
 * the same shape directly.
