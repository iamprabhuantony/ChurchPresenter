/**
 * The largest size at or below [maxFontSize] at which a chord chart fits the space it is given.
 *
 * Measuring a chart as if it were ordinary text does not work. `ChordChart` stacks a chord row above
 * every row of words — the chord `Text` is composed even where a segment carries no chord, so it
 * takes its line box regardless — and a long line wraps into several such rows, each one costing
 * both heights again. Summing the words alone under-reports all of that, which is how a chart that
 * had already been "fitted" still ran off the bottom of the zone.
 *
 * So height comes from what the chart actually draws, and the measurer is used for the one thing it
 * is needed for: how many rows a line takes once it has wrapped to the width available. Wrapping is
 * allowed — forbidding it would fit the longest line rather than the zone, and shrink the whole
 * chart to suit one line nobody asked to be unbroken.
 *
 * A line of chords with no words under it is a single row, not a stacked pair — that is the intro
 * case, written along the line rather than above it.
