 * call sites did it inline in composition — so every settings dialog open paid for it again, on the
 * UI thread, before the dialog could paint. The set cannot change while the app runs (the bundled
 * faces are registered once at startup), so one snapshot serves every picker.
 *
 * Warmed from `main()` after `SlideFontRegistry` registers the bundled faces, so those are in the
 * snapshot; [rememberSystemFonts] covers the cold case without blocking.
