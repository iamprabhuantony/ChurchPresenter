/**
 * The system clipboard, for the app's own copy buttons.
 *
 * The clipboard is a single OS-wide lock that any running application can be holding, so every call
 * into it can fail for a reason that has nothing to do with this app and is over a moment later.
 * Windows raises `IllegalStateException: cannot open system clipboard` from
 * `WClipboard.openClipboard0` when it cannot take that lock — which reached Sentry as a fatal, and
 * would have taken any of the app's six unguarded copy buttons with it had one been clicked at the
 * wrong moment.
 *
 * So neither call here throws. A copy that could not happen is one the operator repeats; it is not
 * worth a report, and it is certainly not worth ending whatever they were doing.
