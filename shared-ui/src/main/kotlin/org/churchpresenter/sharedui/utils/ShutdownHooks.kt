/**
 * Registers a JVM shutdown hook whose body cannot turn a clean exit into a reported crash.
 *
 * A shutdown hook runs on its own thread, so anything it throws goes to the default uncaught
 * handler — which is `CrashReporter`. The app has already closed successfully by then, and the
 * user sees nothing, but a `fatal` event is filed as though it had crashed. That is what happened
 * to the resource census hook: it was the first thing to ask for a class, the class could not be
 * loaded during exit, and a clean shutdown was reported as a crash.
 *
 * `Throwable` and not `Exception`: the observed failure was a `NoClassDefFoundError`, and the
 * shutdown path is exactly where `Error`s of that shape appear. Failing to release something while
 * the process is ending is not worth a report — the OS reclaims it either way.
 *
 * [name] names the thread, so a hang during shutdown is identifiable in a thread dump.
