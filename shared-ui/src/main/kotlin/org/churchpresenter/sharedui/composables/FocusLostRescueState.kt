 * Focus-lost rescue for tabs whose keyboard shortcuts (arrow keys, clicker keys) only work
 * while something inside the tab holds keyboard focus. Detects BOTH in-window focus loss
 * (operator clicked another panel) and whole-WINDOW focus loss — Compose keeps the focused
 * node "focused" when the window deactivates, so onFocusChanged alone can't see the operator
 * switching away, but keys stop arriving all the same.
 *
 * Every piece of this machinery was verified hands-on on macOS; see the comments on each part
 * before "simplifying" anything.
