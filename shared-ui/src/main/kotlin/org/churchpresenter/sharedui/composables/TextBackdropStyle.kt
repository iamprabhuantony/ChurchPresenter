 * what the person setting them is deciding: both answer one question ("what sits behind these
 * words?"), and asking it twice meant two buttons and two dialogs to see one result — and a pair of
 * answers, "band per line" and "box round the block", that contradict each other when both are
 * given. So the editor collapses the pair into this, and writes it back through [withMode].
