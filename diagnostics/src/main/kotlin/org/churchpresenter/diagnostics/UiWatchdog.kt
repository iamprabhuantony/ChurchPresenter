/**
 * Notices when the UI's event thread stops answering, and says where it was stuck.
 *
 * Every output window composes on that thread, so a stall there is a frozen screen for the
 * audience. The detector is told when a ping was posted to the thread and when it was answered; a
 * ping still unanswered past [budgetMs] reports the thread's stack **once per stall**, while it is
 * still stuck -- afterwards the stack is gone -- and, when the thread answers, how long it was out.
 * It holds no thread and no clock of its own, so a test drives it with numbers.
 *
 * [stack] is the event thread's current stack, [report] where a line goes (the app: `Log.warn`).
 * The event thread answers and the watchdog thread polls, so every call takes the detector's lock.
