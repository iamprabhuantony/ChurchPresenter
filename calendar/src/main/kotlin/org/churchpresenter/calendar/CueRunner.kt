/**
 * Runs the live schedule's automation — the engine.
 *
 * It watches **the schedule that is loaded**, through [items], [timing] and [armed], and nothing
 * else: the Schedule tab is what runs, so what it shows armed is exactly what will fire. A service
 * planned on the calendar fires only once it has been loaded, which is also what makes the
 * Schedule the one place to look to know what is about to happen.
 *
 * Two kinds of thing fire. A **row that starts on its own** (`RowTiming.startAt`) is put on screen
 * at its time, playing its repeats; when its run length is up, its end action runs — the next
 * content row goes live, or the outputs blank. A **cue row** does its action at its time. The
 * app starts [run] once and it stays up for the session.
