/**
 * How a cue is described, wherever it is drawn.
 *
 * The run of show, the settings tab and the toast all say what a cue does, and all three go through
 * the same words so they cannot drift — which only holds if every action has words. Each of these
 * is a `when` over `CueAction`, so an action added without a label would quietly fall through to
 * the catch-all and be described as something it is not.
