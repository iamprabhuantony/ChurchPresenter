/**
 * What the operator sees in the Web tab between going live and the first frame arriving.
 *
 * Mirror mode is the default once a page is live: the tab stops rendering its own browser and shows
 * the presenter's screenshot instead, so that what is checked here is the picture the operator uses
 * to see what the congregation is looking at. Until the first snapshot lands there is a spinner, and
 * after a long enough wait a hint saying why one might never arrive.
 *
 * [WebTabLiveTest] drives live mode, the mirror/interactive toggle and the type-to-page field, but
 * never sets a snapshot — so the whole `webSnapshot != null` branch, and the placeholder that stands
 * in for it, went unexercised. Nothing proved the mirrored image ever appears at all.
 *
 * **What this cannot reach, and why.** The mirrored image forwards mouse, scroll and keyboard input
 * to the presenter's live `CefBrowser` by reflection. Those bodies need a real browser — a JCEF
 * render surface, which is not available headless — and every one of them begins with a
 * `liveBrowser == null` early return. So the tests below drive the input paths with no browser
 * attached, which covers the guard and pins that the mirror is inert rather than crashing; the
 * forwarding itself stays uncovered and is listed in the coverage plan under JCEF.
 *
 * The hint text is chosen from `os.name` — macOS gets a Screen Recording permission hint, everything
 * else a plain wait message. Only the host's own branch is asserted here. Faking `os.name` to reach
 * the other one would resolve skiko's host OS against the fake and break every later Compose test in
 * the JVM, which is the trap `TestSingletons.latchSkikoHostOs` exists for.
