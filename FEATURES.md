# Church Presenter — Features

**Everything your church needs to put words on the screen — songs, scripture, slides, video, captions and broadcast graphics — in one free, open-source app.** 

> Source paths below are relative to `composeApp/src/jvmMain/kotlin/org/churchpresenter/app/churchpresenter/`
>
> Except `data/settings/…` and `data/SettingsManager.kt`, which live in the `:settings` module
> under `settings/src/main/kotlin/org/churchpresenter/settings/` — the paths below keep the old
> shape for readability; the package there is `org.churchpresenter.settings`.

## Songs & Lyrics
- **Unlimited song library** — organize thousands of songs across as many songbooks as you like, indexed straight from a folder.
- **Powerful search** — find songs by title or number with contains, starts-with, exact-match and phrase filters, plus category and songbook filters.
- **Built-in song editor** — add and edit songs with simple verse/chorus formatting; no external tools needed.
- **Song Library Manager** — every song in one editable grid: search, filter by song book, show the columns you care about, type straight into a cell, and change a field on a whole selection at once. Renumbering a book, filling in missing composers or moving a set into a new song book is one screen rather than one song at a time.
- **Bilingual worship** — show two languages at once, side-by-side or stacked, or switch between primary and secondary on the fly.
- **Look-ahead for the band** — see the current and next section in advance so transitions stay smooth.
- **Favorites & play counts** — star the songs you use most and see how often each has been sung.
- **Bring your existing library** — the bundled converter reads SongBeamer, OpenLP (the `songs.sqlite` database itself or an OpenLyrics export), OpenSong, FreeShow, Free Worship, EasySlides, Quelea, VideoPsalm and SoftProjector libraries, plus lyrics pulled out of PDF, Word, PowerPoint and Keynote files — several files or a whole folder at a time — and ready-to-use sample songs ship with the app.
- **Flexible display** — one verse or one line at a time, optional title slides, and full control over how numbers and titles appear.

## Bible & Scripture
- **Instant verse display** — browse any of the 66 books and put a verse on screen in seconds.
- **Dual and multi-translation modes** — keep the original primary/secondary workflow (including
  lower-third styling), or switch to an independent ordered stack of any number of translations.
  Multi-translation mode uses one full-screen typography profile per translation and has no
  lower-third-specific settings.
- **Multi-verse ranges** — select and present several verses at once with Ctrl/Shift click.
- **Search the whole Bible** — search across the entire text or just the current book.
- **History** — jump back to recently shown passages instantly.
- **Strong's dictionary** — explore original Hebrew and Greek words with transliteration, pronunciation, definitions and KJV usage.
- **Download translations in-app** — browse over 1,500 translations in more than 1,000 languages from eBible.org and the Zefania XML archive, filter by language, and install one in a click: it downloads and converts on your machine, straight into your Bible folder, with its copyright shown up front.
- **Follow along automatically** — connect a live speech-to-text feed and the app listens for spoken Bible references — stated outright or simply the next verse in a passage being read — and stages or goes live with the matching verse on its own, tiered by confidence so only clear matches jump straight to the screen.

- **Audio & video playback** — play local files or network streams (HTTP, RTSP and more), powered by VLC.
- **Full transport controls** — play, pause, seek, volume, mute, and choose your audio output device.

- **Built-in generator** — design your own animated lower thirds with the included Lottie generator — no After Effects needed.
- **Fine timing control** — pause on a frame, hold, and play through with smooth fade in/out.
- **Animated Bible lower third** — opt in to a Lottie band for scripture: the band slides, wipes, unrolls or fades in on Go Live, each verse types, scrolls like a ticker, fades or slides in as you step through a passage, and everything animates out on Escape. Design it in the built-in Bible band generator, with your Bible fonts, sizes and colors filled in live, for one or two languages.

## Announcements & Timers
- **On-screen announcements** — show text anywhere on screen with a wide range of slide and scroll animations, custom colors, speed and looping.

## Web & Canvas
- **Live websites on screen** — present any web page with bookmarks, navigation and zoom, and even type into live pages.
- **Canvas scene compositor** — build layered scenes from images, text, video, shapes, gradients, clocks, QR codes, live cameras, screen capture, NDI sources from the network, web pages and Bible verses — like a mini production switcher inside the app.
- **QR codes made easy** — generate QR codes for URLs, WiFi, contact cards, email, SMS and more, right on the slide.
- **Cameras that just work** — ChurchPresenter carries its own copy of ffmpeg, so a webcam or capture card can be put on the canvas without installing anything first. Point it at a different ffmpeg from Settings → Projection if you would rather use your own.
- **NDI sources on the canvas** — receive any NDI source on your network as a layer: a camera from another machine, a graphics feed, an overflow room's output. Pick it from a list of what is sending, or drop to the sender's low-bandwidth proxy for a small layer on a busy network. Needs the same free NDI Runtime as NDI output.

- **Full moderation** — approve, deny, sort and queue questions before any go live.
- **Anywhere access** — optional public access lets people ask over mobile data without joining your WiFi.
- **Voting & history** — let the room upvote approved questions, and export the session afterward.

## Service Planning
- **Drag-and-drop schedules** — build your whole service from songs, scripture, slides, media, lower thirds, announcements and websites.
- **Save & reopen services** — store schedules as files and pick up exactly where you left off, with autosave and crash recovery.
- **Stay organized** — color-coded labels, per-item notes, quick reordering, recents and full undo/redo.

**Source locations:**
- `tabs/ScheduleTab.kt` — main UI

## Projection & Output
- **Unlimited outputs** — drive as many screens as you have — one window per connected display, plus every DeckLink/SDI device. No artificial limit.
- **Full screen or lower third** — present full-screen or as a lower-third band, per content type.
- **Beautiful backgrounds** — solid colors, images, looping video, gradients or transparent — set defaults and per-type overrides.
- **Built-in stock photo & video search** — search and download from Pexels and Pixabay right inside the app with a free API key, plus a set of preloaded backgrounds ready to use offline.
- **Broadcast fill + key** — output separate fill and key signals for hardware keying, including SDI via Blackmagic DeckLink.
- **Browser Source streaming output** — a transparent, OBS-ready browser-source overlay with true alpha transparency, crossfaded mode switching and configurable per-output resolution/fps — for lower thirds, media, websites and more, no OBS scene-switching integration required.
- **NDI output** — send live content over the network as an NDI® source and pick it up in OBS, vMix or a hardware switcher, with no capture card. Alpha mode carries genuine per-pixel transparency, so a lower third arrives already keyed — no second source, no downstream keyer. Fill-only and discrete fill + key are there for gear that wants them. Needs the free NDI Runtime, installed separately and detected automatically, exactly as VLC is.
- **Typography that fits** — auto-fit text to the screen, with control over fonts, size, alignment, shadows and margins.
- **Live preview** — always see exactly what's on screen, and lock any output to a chosen tab.

## Multi-Room & Instance Linking
- **Follow another instance live** — link a second ChurchPresenter instance — an overflow room, a secondary campus, a confidence feed — so it automatically mirrors whatever the primary sends live: Bible, songs, pictures, presentations, media, canvas, Q&A and dictionary entries.
- **Resilient by design** — automatic reconnect with backoff, a heartbeat that surfaces a dead link within seconds instead of freezing on stale content, and command acknowledgement so remote actions never silently fail.

- `viewmodel/InstanceLinkViewModel.kt`
- `data/settings/InstanceLinkSettings.kt`
- `dialogs/InstanceLinkDialog.kt`, `dialogs/InstanceLinkToast.kt`

- **Pick a period** — last 3, 6 or 12 months, any calendar year, all time, or an exact From/To range.
- **CCLI usage reports** — export date-filtered CSV/Excel for license reporting, with CCLI numbers resolved from your song library.

**Source locations:**
- `data/StatisticsManager.kt`
