 * about legibility rather than a limit the layout has, and it was made where nothing could see it:
 * a stack of six on a band drew four and dropped two with nothing on screen saying so. The auto-fit
 * below already shrinks whatever it is given until every translation is inside its own cell, so a

 * is far past anything real: the worst genuine case, every translation of a long passage crammed into

 * however many translations are stacked or however long the passage. So this does not take a floor:
 * full size is returned when it fits, and otherwise it starts from [startScale], halving while that
 * does not fit — down to [MIN_FIT_SCALE] — before bisecting upward for the largest scale that does.
 *
 * That halving is the part it used to be missing. It began at a fixed 15% floor and returned that
 * floor without ever testing it, so a caller could not tell "the largest scale that fits" from
 * "nothing in range fits" and got silent overflow for the second (issue #97). Raising the floor made
 * that worse rather than better: it turned unreadably-small into cut-off.
 *
 * A caveat for callers: everything contributing to the measured height has to scale with the argument.
 * A predicate holding part of its height fixed — a reference line measured once at full size — can be
 * unsatisfiable at any scale, and no search can rescue that.
