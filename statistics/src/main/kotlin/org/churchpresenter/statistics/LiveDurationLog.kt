/**
 * How long each thing actually stays on screen, so a plan can be timed from what happened rather
 * than from a guess.
 *
 * Nobody is asked to run a stopwatch: every row that goes live is timed until the next one does or
 * the outputs blank, and the **median** of what has been seen is offered as that item's length.
 * The median rather than the mean because one Sunday where the song was left up through the
 * offering should not move the number much.
 *
 * Two rules keep the numbers honest:
 * - Anything under [MIN_SECONDS] is thrown away. Stepping through a service to check it, or
 *   clicking the wrong row and correcting it, are not measurements of anything.
 * - Only [KEEP_PER_ITEM] most recent readings are kept per item, so a song sung differently this
 *   year is not held to how it went two years ago.
 *
 * Keyed by what the item *is* -- a song's number and book, a file's path -- never by row id: the
 * point is that this week's row inherits what last week's row of the same thing took.
