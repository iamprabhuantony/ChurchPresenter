/**
 * Where the CCLI number on the licence report comes from.
 *
 * The event log deliberately does not store one — see [SongPlayEvent], which holds only title,
 * songbook, number and author — so every number in the report is resolved at export time by reading
 * the song catalog off disk and matching against it. That matching is the whole report: a song that
 * fails to match is filed with an empty CCLI column, which is a licence report that does not credit
 * the song, and a song that matches the WRONG catalog entry credits somebody else's.
 *
 * Two keys, in order: songbook + song number first (stable when a title is edited), then songbook +
 * lowercased title. A song sung before its catalog entry existed simply gets no number rather than
 * failing the export.
 *
 * `user.home` is swapped per test — the manager resolves its files from it at construction, and the
 * catalog path is read from settings on every query.
