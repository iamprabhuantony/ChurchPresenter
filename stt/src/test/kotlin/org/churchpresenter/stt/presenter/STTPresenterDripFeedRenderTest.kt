/**
 * The drip feed as the room sees it — the letter-by-letter caption reveal, driven by the
 * "Speed (ms/letter)" setting on the STT tab.
 *
 * These cover the reported failure: at any speed slower than roughly the default the reveal used to
 * restart on every arriving segment, so the pace on screen was set by the STT server's segment
 * cadence and 100, 120 and 140 ms/letter were indistinguishable. The knob has to be the thing that
 * decides the pace, and a segment landing mid-reveal must not snap the sentence before it to full.
 *
 * Every wait here is on the test's VIRTUAL clock (`autoAdvance = false` + `advanceTimeBy`), so the
 * timing is exact and the tests cost no wall-clock time. The reveal only runs on text that arrives
 * after the first composition — an output opened mid-service deliberately inherits its backlog
 * whole rather than re-typing it — so each case starts from an empty caption and then speaks.
