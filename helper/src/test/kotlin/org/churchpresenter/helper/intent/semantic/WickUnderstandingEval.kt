/**
 * How well Wick understands what an operator types, measured on `wick/understanding.tsv`: rewordings of
 * every chip that share few words with it, typos, and requests it should not act on.
 *
 * Each row ends one of four ways: acted on rightly, offered the right chip among the first three, not
 * understood, or — the one that must never happen — acted on wrongly. It prints the table and the
 * totals, and fails on any wrong action or when the right answer is reached for fewer than [MIN_REACHED]
 * of the rows that have one.
 *
 * Tagged `eval` and run by `./gradlew :helper:wickEval`, not `test`: every row runs the model, which
 * puts the whole table over the unit suite's one-second budget.
