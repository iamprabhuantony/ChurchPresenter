/**
 * Where a schedule row's parts actually land, at each density.
 *
 * Both invariants here are about geometry rather than content, and both were broken in the redesign
 * in ways no existing test could see: every suite asserted on what a row *says*, and a row that says
 * the right thing in the wrong place passes all of them.
 *
 *  * **The title sits on the row's centreline.** The content column is stretched to whichever
 *    sibling is taller, and at Compact that is the action-button row — a single ~20dp title line
 *    against ~30dp of buttons — so a top-aligned title sat visibly high in its own card. Normal and
 *    Detailed masked it: their detail lines make the content column the taller sibling, so there is
 *    no slack for it to sit at the top of.
 *  * **The hover scrim covers the card.** The action strip's gradient is its own background, so it
 *    is exactly as tall as the strip. Left at the buttons' ~30dp inside a 54dp Detailed card, it was
 *    a band floating in the middle with the card's own background showing above and below it.
 *
 * The type chip is the reference for the centreline: it is laid out `CenterVertically` in the row,
 * so its centre *is* the row's centre, and comparing against it needs no font metrics — which is
 * what makes this safe across the three target platforms. The tolerance is 2dp-ish in pixels rather
 * than exact, because a text line's own centre and a 26dp box's centre round differently.
