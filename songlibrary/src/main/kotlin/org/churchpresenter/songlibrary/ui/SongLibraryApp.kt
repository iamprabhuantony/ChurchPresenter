 * The Song Library Manager: every song in the library folder in one grid, editable in place.

 * The library is a folder of `.song` files and a person's only view of it is otherwise one song at
 * a time, so anything that spans songs — renumbering a book, filling in a missing composer, moving
 * a set into a new song book — means opening each of them. This is that work in one screen: type in
 * a cell, tick a row, and nothing touches the disk until Save.
