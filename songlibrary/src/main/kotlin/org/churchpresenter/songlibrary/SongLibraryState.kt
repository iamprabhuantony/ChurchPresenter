/**
 * What the window is showing and what has been typed into it.
 *
 * The decisions live in `models.songs` (`:core-models`) — this holds the answers where Compose can see them,
 * and is the one place that touches the disk: everything else asks it to.
 *
 * **Everything a library-sized list makes expensive is handled here, not at the call site.** A
 * library is thousands of songs, every row of the grid reads this on every frame, and the two ways
 * that goes wrong are a `get()` that recomputes the whole library per read and a disk write on the
 * thread that draws:
 * - What the grid reads — [rows], [songbooks], [counts], [visibleColumns] — is
 *   `derivedStateOf`, so it is computed when [songs]/[view] change and cached until they do. As
 *   plain getters they filtered and sorted the entire library on **every** read, and [songbooks]
 *   was read once per visible row: a full scan and sort of the library, twenty-five times a frame.
 * - [selected] and [hiddenColumns] are sets. Membership is tested per row per frame
 *   (`song.sourceFile in selected`), and against a list that is O(n) — quadratic once "select all"
 *   has been used on a big library.
 * - Every function that touches the disk is `suspend` and does the file work under [io]. Only the
 *   load was ever off-thread; [save] wrote every changed file and then re-read the whole folder
 *   inline, which is the same seconds-long freeze the load was moved off the thread to avoid.
