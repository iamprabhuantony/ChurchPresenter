/**
 * What the window shows while the folder is still being read.
 *
 * A real library takes seconds to walk and parse, and for that whole time the window is the only
 * thing on screen — so "reading" has to be distinguishable from "empty", or the operator is told
 * their library is gone. Only reachable because [SongLibraryApp] takes the dispatcher it reads on:
 * [Gate] holds the load open for as long as the assertions need.
