/**
 * The chord a key event should be recorded as, or null to keep waiting.
 *
 * Split out of the UI because both places that listen for a combination need exactly this decision
 * and nothing else — the row being rebound, and the dialog's "Press key" search — and because it is
 * plain Kotlin, so it is unit-tested directly rather than driven through a composable.
 *
 * Returns null for a key-up (the press is what counts) and for a bare modifier: holding Ctrl emits
 * its own key-down before the real key arrives, and recording that would bind the action to "Ctrl".
 *
 * **Escape yields a chord like any other key.** It is the default binding for Clear Output, so
 * treating it as "cancel" here would make that one action impossible to rebind.
