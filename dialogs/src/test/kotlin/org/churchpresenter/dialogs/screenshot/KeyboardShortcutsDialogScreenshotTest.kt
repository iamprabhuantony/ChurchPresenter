/**
 * The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog (Help → Keyboard Shortcuts, F1), in both themes.
 *
 * A category rail on the left, one category's rows beside it, and Cancel/Apply/OK under both. This
 * is the only place shortcuts are both listed and changed — the editing UI was briefly a Settings
 * tab and was merged in here, and the separate capture window was folded into the row.
 *
 * What changes the shape of a row rather than a value in it:
 *
 *  - **Whether the action is customized.** The caps are tinted, and the row's one button turns from
 *    *Clear* into *Reset*. The footer also starts counting, but only against what was passed in.
 *  - **Whether the action is bound at all.** An unbound row reads "Not set" rather than empty caps.
 *  - **Whether it clashes with another binding.** The row, its caps and the rail entry all take the
 *    error colour and the row names what else answers to the combination.
 *  - **Whether it is listening.** The caps are replaced by the recording chip for as long as the
 *    row holds the keyboard.
 *
 * Light and dark are **separate images** here rather than stacked: the dialog is 720 tall, and a
 * stacked pair is a strip no reviewer can take in at once.
 *
 * **These are macOS renders**, so modifiers appear as `⌃⌥⇧⌘` rather than `Ctrl+Alt+…`. That is what
 * the same code produces on this platform, not a defect — see the platform table in AGENT.md before
 * re-recording anywhere else.
