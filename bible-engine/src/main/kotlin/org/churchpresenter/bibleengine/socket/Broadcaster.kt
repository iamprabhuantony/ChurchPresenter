/**
 * Fans emitted events out to every connected WebSocket client without ever blocking the
 * producer: each session gets its own bounded channel (drop-oldest) drained by a dedicated
 * sender coroutine, so one slow/stalled client can no longer back-pressure the detection
 * pipeline or the STT ingest thread (which previously `runBlocking`-sent to every session
 * sequentially). Dropping the oldest frame is safe — scripture events are idempotent UI
 * hints, and a starved client's next frame supersedes what it missed. (A dropped
 * `scripture.detected` may be followed by an `updated` for the same ref; consumers treat
 * both alike.)
 *
 * [broadcastStatus] and [broadcastVersion] additionally cache their latest message and replay
 * it to every newly registered session, so a late-joining ChurchPresenter learns the engine's
 * STT link state and the version being read without waiting for the next transition. Both are
 * standing state rather than events, which is why they are replayed and scripture is not.
