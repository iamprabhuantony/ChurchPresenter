/**
 * Pulling a Planning Center attachment onto disk.
 *
 * This is how a service plan's PDFs and images actually arrive: the app resolves a one-time
 * download URL from the API and then fetches it, usually from S3 rather than from Planning Center
 * itself. Everything about that fetch is worth pinning because it is binary and it is a file the
 * operator will open — bytes have to land byte for byte, a server error must not leave a truncated
 * or empty file looking like a successful download, and the two failure kinds have to stay
 * distinguishable, since one is worth retrying and the other is not.
 *
 * Unlike the rest of this client, these two take their URL as a parameter, so they can be pointed
 * at a local server rather than at planningcenteronline.com.
