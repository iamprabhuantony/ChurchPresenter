/**
 * Matching a Planning Center plan item against the local song library.
 *
 * This decides whether an import reuses the song the church already has or creates a second copy
 * of it, so each tier is driven directly rather than through a mocked plan load: CCLI number
 * first, then a leading four-digit song number, then the title. A tier that matches nothing has
 * to fall through to the next one rather than stopping the search.
